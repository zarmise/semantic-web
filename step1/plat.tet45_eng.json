The cause of this has been nothing human, but a certain spiritual opposition, of whose power you shall be informed at some later time.  However, it now opposes me no longer,\nso I have accordingly come to you;  and I am in good hopes that it will not oppose me again in the future.  Now I have been observing you all this time, and have formed a pretty good notion of your behavior to your lovers:  for although they were many and high-spirited, everyone of them has found your spirit too strong for him and has run away. \nLet me explain the reason of your spirit being too much for them.  You say you have no need of any man in any matter;  for your resources are so great, beginning with the body and ending with the soul, that you lack nothing.  You think, in the first place, that you are foremost in beauty and statureand you are not mistaken in this, as is plain for all to seeand in the second place, that you are of the most gallant family in your city, the greatest city in , and\nthat there you have, through your father, very many of the best people as your friends and kinsmen, who would assist you in case of need, and other connections also, through your mother, who are not a whit inferior to these, nor fewer.  And you reckon upon a stronger power than all those that I have mentioned, in Pericles, son of Xanthippus, whom your father left as guardian of you and your brother when he died, and who is able to do whatever he likes not only in this city but all over  and among many great nations of the barbarians. \nAnd I will add besides the wealth of your house:  but on this, I observe, you presume least of all.  Well, you puff yourself up on all these advantages, and have overcome your lovers, while they in their inferiority have yielded to your might, and all this has not escaped you;  so I am very sure that you wonder what on earth I mean by not getting rid of my passion, and what can be my hope in remaining when the rest have fled."}}, {"speaker": "Alcibiades", "p": {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "104d"}, "#text": "Perhaps also, Socrates, you are not aware that\nyou have only just anticipated me.

Now, although it is hard for a lover to parley with a man who does not yield to lovers, I must make bold nevertheless to put my meaning into words.  For if I saw you, Alcibiades, content with the things I set forth just now, and minded to pass your life in enjoying them, I should long ago have put away my love,\nso at least I persuade myself:  but as it is, I shall propound to your face quite another set of your thoughts, whereby you will understand that I have had you continually before my mind.  For I believe, if some god should ask you:  Alcibiades, do you prefer to live with your present possessions, or to die immediately if you are not to have the chance of acquiring greater things?  I believe you would choose to die.  But let me tell you what I imagine must be the present hope of your life.  You think that if you come shortly before the Athenian Assemblywhich\nyou expect to occur in a very few daysyou will stand forth and prove to the people that you are more worthy of honor than either Pericles or anyone else who has ever existed, and that having proved this you will have the greatest power in the state;  and that if you are the greatest here, you will be the same among all the other Greeks, and not only Greeks, but all the barbarians who inhabit the same continent with us.  And if that same god should say to you again, that you are to hold sway here in ,\nbut are not to be allowed to cross over into  and to interfere with the affairs of that region, I believe you would be equally loth to live on those sole conditions eitherif you are not to fill, one may say, the whole world with your name and your power;  and I fancy that, except Cyrus and Xerxes, you think there has never existed a single man who was of any account.  So then that this is your hope, I know well enough;  I am not merely guessing.  And I daresay you will reply, since you know that what I say is true:  Well,\nSocrates, and what has that to do with your point?  I am going to tell you, dear son of Cleinias and Deinomache.  Without me it is impossible for all those designs of yours to be crowned with achievement;  so great is the power I conceive myself to have over your affairs and over you, and it is for this very reason, I believe, that the god has so long prevented me from talking with you, and I was waiting to see when he would allow me.  For as\nyou have hopes of proving yourself in public to be invaluable to the state and, having proved it, of winning forthwith unlimited power, so do I hope to win supreme power over you by proving that I am invaluable to you, and that neither guardian nor kinsman nor anyone else is competent to transmit to you the power that you long for except me, with the god's help, however.  In your younger days, to be sure, before you had built such high hopes, the god, as I believe, prevented me from talking with you, in order that I might not waste my words:  but now he has set me on; \nfor now you will listen to me."}}, {"speaker": "Alcibiades", "p": {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "106b"}, "#text": "You seem to me far more extraordinary, Socrates, now that you have begun to speak, than before, when you followed me about in silence;  though even then you looked strange enough.

But take the lines of those people, going back from them:  you have a succession of kings reaching to Zeuson the one hand, kings of  and ;  on the other, of , which they have always ruled, and frequently  also, as at present;  whereas we are private persons ourselves, and so were our fathers.  And then,\nsuppose that you had to make what show you could of your ancestors, and of  as the native land of Eurysaces, or of  as the home of the yet earlier Aeacus, to impress Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes, how you must expect to be laughed at!  Why, I am afraid we are quite outdone by those persons in pride of birth and upbringing altogether.  Or have you not observed how great are the advantages of the Spartan kings, and how their wives are kept under statutory ward of the ephors, in order that every possible precaution may be taken against the king being born\nof any but the Heracleidae?  And the Persian king so far surpasses us that no one has a suspicion that he could have been born of anybody but the king before him;  and hence the king's wife has nothing to guard her except fear.  When the eldest son, the heir to the throne, is born, first of all the king's subjects who are in his palace have a feast, and then for ever after on that date the whole of  celebrates the king's birthday with sacrifice and feasting:  but when we are born, as the comic poet says,\n Alcibiades.  After that comes the nurture of the child, not at the hands of a woman-nurse of little worth, but of the most highly approved eunuchs in the king's service, who are charged with the whole tendance of the new-born child, and especially with the business of making him as handsome as possible by moulding his limbs into a correct shape;  and while doing this they are in high honor. \nWhen the boys are seven years old they are given horses and have riding lessons, and they begin to follow the chase.  And when the boy reaches fourteen years he is taken over by the royal tutors, as they call them there:  these are four men chosen as the most highly esteemed among the Persians of mature age, namely, the wisest one, the justest one, the most temperate one,\nand the bravest one.  The first of these teaches him the magian lore of Zoroaster, son of Horomazes;  and that is the worship of the gods:  he teaches him also what pertains to a king.  The justest teaches him to be truthful all his life long;  the most temperate, not to be mastered by even a single pleasure, in order that he may be accustomed to be a free man and a veritable king, who is the master first of all that is in him, not the slave;  while the bravest trains him to be fearless and undaunted, telling him that to be daunted is to be enslaved.  But you,\nAlcibiades, had a tutor set over you by Pericles from amongst his servants,who was old as to be the most useless of them, Zopyrus the Thracian.  I might describe to you at length the nurture and education of your competitors, were it not too much of a task;  and besides, what I have said suffices to show the rest that follows thereon.  But about your birth, Alcibiades, or nurture or education, or about those of any other Athenian, one may say that nobody cares, unless it be some lover whom you chance to have.  And again, if you chose to glance at the wealth, the luxury,\nthe robes with sweeping trains, the anointings with myrrh, the attendant troops of menials, and all the other refinements of the Persians, you would be ashamed at your own case, on perceiving its inferiority to theirs. Should you choose, again, to look at the temperance and orderliness, the facility and placidity, the magnanimity and discipline, the courage and endurance, and the toil-loving, success-loving, honor-loving spirit of the Spartans, you would count yourself but a child\nin all these things.  If again you regard wealth, and think yourself something in that way, I must not keep silence on this point either, if you are to realize where you stand.  For in this respect you have only to look at the wealth of the Spartans, and you will perceive that our riches here are far inferior to theirs.  Think of all the land that they have both in their own and in the Messenian country:  not one of our estates could compete with theirs in extent and excellence, nor again in ownership of slaves, and especially of those of the helot class, nor yet of horses,\nnor of all the flocks and herds that graze in .  However, I pass over all these things:  but there is more gold and silver privately held in  than in the whole of ;  for during many generations treasure has been passing in to them from every part of , and often from the barbarians also, but not passing out to anyone;  and just as in the fable of Aesop,\nwhere the fox remarked to the lion on the direction of the footmarks, the traces of the money going into  are clear enough, but nowhere are any to be seen of it coming out;  so that one can be pretty sure that those people are the richest of the Greeks in gold and silver, and that among themselves the richest is the king;  for the largest and most numerous receipts of the kind are those of the kings,\nand besides there is the levy of the royal tribute in no slight amount, which the Spartans pay to their kings.  Now, the Spartan fortunes, though great compared with the wealth of other Greeks, are nought beside that of the Persians and their king.  For I myself was once told by a trustworthy person, who had been up to their court, that he traversed a very large tract of excellent land, nearly a day's journey, which the inhabitants called the girdle of the king's wife, and another which was similarly called her veil; \nand many other fine and fertile regions reserved for the adornment of the consort;  and each of these regions was named after some part of her apparel.  So I imagine, if someone should say to the king's mother Amestris, who was wife of Xerxes, The son of Deinomache intends to challenge your son;  the mother's dresses are worth perhaps fifty minae at the outside, while the son has under three hundred acres at Erchiae, she would wonder to what on earth this\nAlcibiades could be trusting, that he proposed to contend against Artaxerxes;  and I expect she would remarkThe only possible things that the man can be trusting to for his enterprise are industry and wisdom;  for these are the only things of any account among the Greeks.  Whereas if she were informed that this Alcibiades who is actually making such an attempt is, in the first place, as yet barely twenty years old, and secondly, altogether uneducated;  and further, that when his lover tells him that he must first learn, and take pains over himself, and practise,\nbefore he enters on a contest with the king, he refuses, and says he will do very well as he is;  I expect she would ask in surprise, On what, then, can the youngster rely?  And if we told her, On beauty, stature, birth, wealth, and mental gifts, she would conclude we were mad, Alcibiades, when she compared the advantages of her own people in all these respects.  And I imagine that even Lampido, daughter of Leotychides\nand wife of Archidamus and mother of Agis, who have all been kings, would wonder in the same way, when she compared her people's resources, at your intention of having a contest with her son despite your bad upbringing.  And yet, does it not strike you as disgraceful that our enemies' wives should have a better idea of the qualities that we need for an attempt against them than we have ourselves?  Ah, my remarkable friend, listen to me and the Delphic motto,\nKnow thyself;  for these people are our competitors, not those whom you think;  and there is nothing that will give us ascendancy over them save only pains and skill.  If you are found wanting in these, you will be found wanting also in achievement of renown among Greeks and barbarians both;  and of this I observe you to be more enamored than anyone else ever was of anything."}}, {"speaker": "Alcibiades", "p": "Well then, what are the pains that I must take, Socrates?

Yet we could tell of\n    \"> many ere now who, having desired sovereignty, and endeavored to secure it, with the idea of working for their good, have lost their lives by plots which their sovereignty has provoked.  And I expect you are not unacquainted with certain events   when Archelaus, the monarch of , was slain by his favorite, who was as much in love with the monarchy as Archelaus was with him, and who killed his lover\nwith the expectation of being not only the monarch, but also a happy man:  but after holding the monarchy for three or four days he was plotted against by others in his turn, and perished.  You have only to look at some of our own citizensand these are examples that we know, not by hearsay, but by personal observationwho in their time have desired to hold military command\nand have obtained it, and see how some to this very day are exiles from our city, while others have lost their lives.  And even those who are deemed to be faring best have not only gone through many dangers and terrors in holding their command, but on returning home have continued to be as sorely besieged by informers as they were by the enemy, so that some of them wished to heaven\nthat they had been anything but commanders rather than have held such appointments.  Of course, if these dangers and toils were conducive to our advantage, there would be some reason for them;  but the case is quite the contrary.  And you will find it is just the same in regard to children:  some people have been known to pray that they might have them, and when they have got them have fallen into the greatest disasters and pains.  For some have had children that were utterly bad, and have spent their whole lives in repining;  while others, though they had good ones,\nwere bereft of them by disasters that overtook them, and thus were cast into as great misfortune as the others, and wished that no children at all had been born to them.  But nevertheless, with all this plain evidence, and a great deal more of a similar kind, before men's eyes, it is rare to find anyone who has either declined what was offered to him or, when he was likely to gain something by prayer, refrained from praying.  Most men would not decline the offer of either a monarchy or a generalship\n    or any of the various other things which bring with them harm rather than benefit, but would even pray to be granted them in cases where they were lacking:  but after a little while they often change their tune, and retract all their former prayers.  I question therefore if men are not really wrong in blaming the gods as the authors of their ills, when or unwisdom, shall we say?\n     It would seem, at any rate, Alcibiades, that one old poet had some wisdom;  for I conceive it was because he had some foolish friends, whom he saw working and praying for things that were not for their advantage, though supposed to be by them, that he made a common prayer on behalf of them all, in terms something like these:\nSo then, to my mind the poet spoke well and soundly;  but if you have thought of an answer to his words, do not be silent."}}, {"speaker": "Alcibiades", "p": {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "143b"}, "#text": "It is difficult, Socrates, to gainsay what has been well spoken:  one thing, however, I do observe how many evils are caused to men by ignorance, when, as it seems, we are beguiled by her not only into doing,\nbutworst of allinto praying to be granted the greatest evils.

The consequence is that to the present time they have been just as fortunate as any other people;  and if it has befallen them to be not invariably fortunate, it was anyhow not owing to their prayer. \nIt rests with the gods, I conceive, to give us either what we may pray for or the reverse. And I would like to give you an account of something else, which I once heard from some of my seniors.  A quarrel having arisen between the Athenians and the Spartans, it befell our city to be always unsuccessful in every battle by land and sea, and she could never win a victory.  So the Athenians, in their annoyance at this result, and at a loss for some means of finding a deliverance from the trouble they were in,\ntook counsel together and decided that the best thing they could do was to send and inquire of Ammon;  and moreover, to ask also for what reason the gods granted victory to the Spartans rather than to themselves:  for wesuch was the message offer up to them more and finer sacrifices than any of the Greeks, and have adorned their temples with votive emblems as no other people have done, and presented to the gods the costliest and stateliest processions year by year, and spent more money thus than\nall the rest of the Greeks together.  But the Spartans have never taken any such pains, and indeed are so neglectful in their behavior to the gods, that they make a practice of sacrificing defective victims, and generally are very much behind us in the honors that they pay, though the wealth they possess is quite equal to that of our city. When they had so spoken, and added the question, what they should do in order to find a deliverance from the trouble they were in,\nthe prophet's only answer  evidently it was all that the god allowedwas to call them to him and say:  Thus saith Ammon to the Athenians:  I would rather have the reverent reserve of the Spartans than all the ritual of the Greeks. So much he said, and not a word further.  Now by reverent reserve I suppose the god could only mean their prayer, since in fact it differs greatly from those that are generally offered. \nFor the Greeks in general either lead up bulls with gilded horns, or else present the gods with votive emblems, and pray for any odd thing, whether it be good or bad:  so when the gods hear their irreverent speech they reject all these costly processions and sacrifices.  Whereas I think we ought to be very cautious, and fully consider what is to be said and what is not. And in Homer too you will find other tales of a similar sort.  For he relates how the Trojans,\n    in making their bivouac,and how the winds bore the sweet savour from the plain into heaven:\nSo it was nothing to their purpose to sacrifice and pay tribute of gifts in vain, when they were hated by the gods.  For it is not, I imagine, the way of the gods to be seduced with gifts, like a base insurer.  And indeed it is but silly talk of ours, if we claim to surpass the Spartans on this score.  For it would be a strange thing if the gods had regard to our gifts and sacrifices instead of our souls, and the piety and\njustice that may be found in any of us.  Far rather at these, I believe, do they look than at those costly processions and sacrifices which are offered, it well may be, by individual and state, year in, year out, though they may have offended greatly against the gods, or as greatly against their neighbors.  But the gods are not to be won by bribes, and so they despise all these things, as Ammon and the holy prophet say.  Certainly it would seem that justice and wisdom are held in especial honor both by the gods and by men of intelligence; \nand wise and just are they alone who know what acts and words to use towards gods and men.  But I should like now to hear what may be your opinion on the subject."}}, {"speaker": "Alcibiades", "p": "Why, Socrates, it in no wise differs from yours and the god's;  for indeed it would not be fitting for me to record my vote against the god."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "150c"}, "#text": "And you remember you professed to be in great perplexity lest you should pray unawares for evil,\nwhile supposing it to be good?"}}, {"speaker": "Alcibiades", "p": "I do."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": {"note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "Loeb", "bibl": {"@n": "Plat.

And when his people in the city had been educated and were admiring him for his wisdom,\nhe proceeded next, with the design of educating those of the countryside, to set up figures of Hermes for them along the roads in the midst of the city and every district town;  and then, after selecting from his own wise lore, both learnt from others and discovered for himself, the things that he considered the wisest, he threw these into elegiac form and inscribed them on the figures as verses of his own and testimonies of his wisdom, so that in the first place\nhis people should not admire those wise Delphic legends of  and , and the other sayings of the sort, but should rather regard as wise the utterances of Hipparchus;  and that in the second place, through passing up and down and reading his words and acquiring a taste for his wisdom, they might resort hither from the country for the completion of their education.

Now it chanced that two of the young people were disputing, but about what, I did not clearly overhear:  it appeared, however, that they were disputing either about Anaxagoras or about Oenopides;  at any rate, they appeared to be drawing circles,\nand they were imitating certain inclinations with their arms, bending to it and taking it most earnestly.  Then Ifor I was sitting beside the lover of one of the pairnudged him with my elbow and asked him what on earth the two youngsters were so earnest about, and I said:  Is it then something great and fine, in which they are so earnestly immersed?Great and fine, indeed!  he replied:  why, these fellows are prating about the heavenly bodies, and babbling philosophy.\nThen I, surprised at his answer, said:  Young man, do you consider philosophizing to be shameful?  Else, why do you speak so sharply?Then the other youthfor he chanced to be sitting near him, as his rival in lovewhen he heard my question and his rival's answer, said:  You do yourself no good, Socrates, by pressing this fellow with a further question, as to whether he considers philosophizing to be shameful.  Do you not know that he has spent the whole of his life in practising the neckhold, and stuffing himself, and sleeping?  So why did you suppose he would make any other reply than that philosophy is shameful?\nNow this one of the two lovers had spent his time on humane studies, whereas the other, whom he was abusing, had spent his on athletics.  So I decided that I had best relinquish the other, whom I had been questioning, since he did not even himself set up to be experienced in words, but only in deeds;  and that I should interrogate the one who set up to be wiser, in order that so far as I was able I might get some benefit from him.  I said therefore:  I addressed my question to both in common;  but if you think you could answer more creditably than he, I put the same question to you as I did to him:  do you consider philosophizing to be honorable or not?\nThen the two striplings, overhearing us speak somewhat like this, were silent, and ceasing from their own contention they became listeners to ours.  What their lovers' sensations were, I do not know, but I myself, at any rate, was staggered;  for every time I am staggered by handsome young people.  It seemed to me, however, that my young friend too was in as great a flutter as myself;  but nevertheless he answered me in a most ambitious spirit:  Why, of course, Socrates, he said, if I should ever consider philosophizing to be shameful, I should not account myself so much as a man,\nnor anyone else either who was disposed to think so.  Here he pointed to his rival lover, and spoke with a loud voice, in order that his favorite might hear every word.Then I remarked:  So philosophizing seems to you to be honorable?Quite so, he said.Well now, I said;  does it seem to you possible to know whether anything is honorable or shameful without knowing what it is fundamentally?No, he said.\nThen do you know, I went on, what philosophizing is?Certainly I do, said he.Then what is it?  I asked.Why, just what Solon called it;  you know it was Solon who said:and I agree with him that a man who intends to philosophize should in this way be ever learning something or other, whether he be younger or older, in order that he may learn as many things as possible in his life.  Now at first I felt there was something in his reply, but then, on second thoughts, I asked him whether he considered philosophy to be much learning.\nTo which he answered:  Certainly.And do you consider philosophy to be merely honorable, I asked, or good as well?Good as well, he said:  very much so.Then do you observe this as peculiar to philosophy, or do you find it similarly in everything else?  For example, do you consider the love of athletics to be not merely honorable, but good as well, or do you not?Whereupon he, most slily, gave a double answer:  To him my statement must be neither ;  but to you, Socrates, I acknowledge it to be both honorable and good: \nfor I consider this the right view.Then I asked him:  Well now, in athletics, do you consider that much exercise is love of athletics?To which he replied:  Certainly, just as in philosophizing I consider much learning to be philosophy.Then I said:  And do you then consider that the lovers of athletics desire anything else than that which will cause them to be in good bodily condition?Only that, he replied.And does much exercise, I asked, cause them to be in good bodily condition?\nYes, for how, he replied, could one be in good bodily condition through little exercise?Here I felt it was time to stir up the lover of athletics, in order that he might give me the support of his athletic experience;  so I proceeded to ask him:  And you then, pray, why are you silent, excellent sir, while your friend here is speaking thus?  Do you agree that men are in good bodily condition through much exercise, or is it rather through moderate exercise?For my part, Socrates, he said, I thought even a pig\nas the saying iswould have known that moderate exercise causes them to be in good bodily condition, so why should not a fellow who is sleepless and unfed, with unchafed neck and slender, care-worn frame!  And when he had said this the boys were delighted and laughed their approval, while the other lover blushed.Then I said to him:  Well, do you now concede that it is neither much, nor little, but moderate exercise that causes men to be in good bodily condition?  Or do you bid defiance to the two of us on this point?\nTo which he answered:  Against him I should be only too glad to fight it out, and I am certain I should prove able to support the theory I have put forward, even had I put forward a weaker one;  for he is naught.  But with you I do not aim at winning an unscrupulous success;  and so I admit that not a great but a moderate amount of athletics causes good condition in men.And what of food?  Moderate or much?  I asked.The same applied to food, he admitted.\nThen I went on and tried to compel him also to admit that everything else connected with the body when most beneficial, was the moderate thing, not the much or the little;  and he admitted that it was the moderate thing.And now, I said, as regards the soul;  are moderate or immoderate things beneficial, as adjuncts of it?Moderate things, he replied.And are studies among the adjuncts of the soul?He admitted they were.So among these also it is the moderate that are beneficial, and not the much?He agreed.Then whom should we be justified in asking what sort of exercise or food is moderate for the body?The three of us agreed that it must be a doctor or a trainer.\nAnd whom should we ask about the moderate measure in the sowing of seed?In that matter, we agreed, it must be a farmer.And whom should we be justified in asking as to the moderate degree and kind, in regard to the sowing and planting of studies in the soul?At this point we all began to be full of perplexity; \nthen I, mocking at them, asked:  Do you mind, since we are in perplexity, if we ask these boys here?  or perhaps we are ashamed, as Homer said the suitors were, and do not think it fit there should be someone else who will string the bow?Then, as it seemed to me that they were losing their zeal for the argument, I tried to pursue the inquiry in another way, and said:  But what, as nearly as we can guess, are the kinds of learning which the philosopher should learn, since he is not to learn all things or many things?\nAt this the wiser one interjected:  The finest and most suitable kinds of learning are those which will bring him the most reputation for philosophy;  and he will get most reputation if he appears well versed in all the arts, or if not in all, in as many of them, and those the most considerable, as he can, by learning so much of them as befits a free man to learn, that is, what belongs to the understanding rather than the handiwork of each.Well now, do you mean, I asked, in the same way as in carpentry?  For there, you know, you can buy a carpenter for five\nor six minae, but a first-rate architect cannot be got for even ten thousand drachmae;  few such, indeed, could be found throughout the whole of .  Is it something of this sort that you mean?  When he heard me say this, he admitted that something like this was what he himself meant.I next asked him if it was not impossible for the same person to learn in this way merely two of the arts, not to speak of many or the principal ones;  to which he replied:  Do not conceive me, Socrates,\nto be stating that the philosopher must have accurate knowledge of each of the arts, like the actual adept in any of them;  I mean only so far as may be expected of a free and educated man:  that is, he should be able to follow the explanations of the craftsman more readily than the rest of the company, and to contribute an opinion of his own which will make him appear the cleverest and most accomplished of the company who may at any time be present at some verbal or practical exposition of the arts.Then, as I was still unsettled in my mind as to the drift of his words, I asked him:  Do I quite grasp the sort of man whom you mean by the philosopher? \nFor you seem to me to mean someone like the all-round athletes in contest with the runners or the wrestlers:  the former yield, you know, to the latter in their particular exercises, and are their inferiors in these, but are superior to the usual sort of athletes and beat them.  I daresay it may be something of this sort that you would suggest as the effect produced by philosophy on those who make it their pursuit:  they yield to those who are first-rate\nin an understanding of the arts, but in taking the second place they surpass the rest;  and in this way the man who has studied philosophy comes just next to the top in everything.  That is the kind of person whom you appear to me to indicate.You are quite right, it seems to me, Socrates, he said, in your conception of the philosopher's position, with your comparison of him to the all-round athlete.  For it is precisely his nature not to be enslaved to any business, or to work out anything exactly, so as to let his application to that one matter make him deficient in the rest,\nas the craftsmen do, but to have a moderate contact with all of them.Well, after this answer I was eager to know clearly what he meant, so I inquired of him whether he conceived of good men as useful or useless.Useful, I should say, Socrates, he replied.Then if good men are useful, are wicked men useless?He agreed that they were.Again, do you consider that philosophers are useful persons or not?\nHe agreed that they were useful;  nay, more, that he considered they were most useful of all.Come now, let us make out, if what you say is true, where these second-best men are also useful to us:  for clearly the philosopher is inferior to any particular adept in the arts.He agreed.Well now, I went on, if you yourself, or one of your friends for whom you feel great concern, should have fallen sick, would you fetch that second-best man into the house with a view to obtaining health, or would you summon a doctor?\nFor my part, I should have both, he replied.Please do not say both, I said, but which of the two you would prefer and also summon first.No one, he replied,would make any question but that the doctor should be preferred and also summoned first.And again, if you were in a ship that was making rough weather, to which would you rather entrust yourself and yours, the pilot or the philosopher?I should choose the pilot.And so it will be in everything else:  so long as there is some craftsman, the philosopher will not be useful?Apparently, he replied.\nSo now we find that the philosopher is a useless person?  For I suppose we always have craftsmen;  and we have agreed that good men are useful, and bad ones useless.He was obliged to agree to this.Then what follows?  Am I to ask you, or will it be too ill-mannered?Ask whatever you please.Well, my aim, I said, is merely to recall our agreements upon\nwhat has been stated.  The matter stands somewhat like this.  We agreed that philosophy is an honorable thing, and that philosophers are good;  and that good men are useful, and wicked men useless:  but then again we agreed that philosophers, so long as we have craftsmen, are useless, and that we always do have craftsmen.  Has not all this been agreed?Yes, to be sure, he replied.Then we agreed, it seems, by your accountif philosophizing means having knowledge of the arts in the way you describethat philosophers are wicked and useless so long as there are arts\namong mankind.  But I expect they are not so really, my friend, and that philosophizing is not just having a concernment in the arts or spending one's life in meddlesome stooping and prying and accumulation of learning, but something else;  because I imagined that this life was actually a disgrace, and that people who concerned themselves with the arts were called sordid. But we shall know more definitely whether this statement of mine is true, if you will answer me this:  What men know how to punish horses rightly? \nIs it those who make them into the best horses, or some other men?Those who make them into the best horses.Or again, is it not the men who know how to make dogs into the best dogs that know also how to punish them rightly?Yes.Then it is the same art that makes them into the best dogs and punishes them rightly?It appears so to me, he replied.Again, is the art that makes them into the best ones and punishes them rightly the same as that which knows the good and the bad ones, or is it some other?The same, he said.Then in the case of men also will you be prepared to agree that the art\nwhich makes them into the best men is that which punishes them rightly and distinguishes the good and the bad ones?Certainly, he said.And that which does this to one, does it also to many, and that which does it to many, does it also to one?Yes.And so it is also with horses and everything else?I agree.Then what is the knowledge which rightly punishes the licentious and law-breaking people in our cities?  Is it not judicature?Yes.And is it any other art than this that you call justice?No, only this.\nAnd that whereby they punish rightly is that whereby they know the good and bad people?It is.And whoever knows one will know many also?Yes.And whoever does not know many will not know one?I agree.Then if one were a horse, and did not know the good and wicked horses, would one not know which sort one was oneself?I think not.And if one were an ox and did not know the wicked and good oxen, would one not know which sort one was oneself?That is so, he said.And so it would be, if one were a dog?He agreed.\nWell now, when one is a man, and does not know the good and bad men, one surely cannot know whether one is good or wicked oneself, since one is a man also oneself?He granted this.And is not knowing oneself being temperate, or not being temperate?Not being temperate.So knowing oneself is being temperate?I agree, he said.So this is the message, it seems, of the Delphic inscriptionthat one is to practise temperance and justice.It seems so.And it is by this same art that we know also how to punish rightly?Yes.Then that whereby we know how to punish rightly\nis justice, and that whereby we know how to distinguish our own and others' quality is temperance?It seems so, he said.Then justice and temperance are the same thing?Apparently.And further, it is thus, you know, that cities are well orderedwhen the wrongdoers pay the penalty.That is true, he said.Hence this is also statecraft.He concurred.Again, when one man governs a city rightly, is he not called a despot and king?I agree.And he governs by a kingly and despotic art?That is so.And these arts are the same as the former?Apparently.\nAgain, when a man singly governs a house aright, what is he called?  Is he not a house-manager and master?Yes.Then would he also govern his house well by justice, or by some other art?By justice.Hence they are all the same, it seems,king, despot, statesman, house-manager, master, and the temperate man and the just man;  and it is all one art,the kingly, the despotic, the statesman's, the master's, the house-manager's, and justice and temperance.It is so, apparently, he said.\nThen, if it is disgraceful in the philosopher to be unable, when a doctor speaks about the sick, either to follow his remarks or to contribute anything of his own to what is being said or done, and to be in the same case when any other of the craftsmen speaks, is it not disgraceful that he should be unable, when it is a judge or a king or some other of the persons whom we have just instanced, either to follow their words or contribute anything to their business?It must indeed be disgraceful, Socrates, to have nothing to contribute to subjects of such great importance!\nAre we then to say, I asked, that in these matters also he is to be an all-round athlete, a second-rate man, taking the second place in all the subjects of this arthe, the philosopherand is to be useless so long as there is one of these persons;  or that, first of all, he is to entrust his own house to nobody else and is not to take the second place in it, but is himself to judge and punish rightly, if his house is to be well managed?He granted me that it must be so.Secondly, I presume, whether his friends entrust him with an arbitration, or the state charges him to determine\nor judge any matter, it is disgraceful for him, my good friend, in such cases, to be found in the second or third place, and not to lead?I agree.Hence we see, my excellent sir, that philosophizing is very far from being much learning and that affair of busying oneself with the arts.On my saying this the cultivated youth was silent, feeling ashamed for what he had said before, while the unlearned one said it was as I stated;  and the rest of the company praised the argument."}}}}, {"@n": "Theag.", "body": {"head": "Theages", "castList": {"castItem": [{"@type": "role", "role": "Demodocus"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Socrates"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Theages"}]}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "121"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "121a"}], "sp": [{"speaker": "Demodocus", "p": "Socrates, I was wanting to have some private talk with you, if you had time to spare;  even if there is some demand, which is not particularly important, on your time, do spare some, nevertheless, for me."}, {"speaker": "Socrates", "p": "Why, in any case I happen to have time to spare, and for you, moreover, I have plenty.

And I will produce witnesses to convince you of these facts. You know our Charmides here, who has grown so handsome, the son of Glaucon: \nhe once happened to be consulting me on his intention of training for the Nemean races, and he had no sooner begun to say that he intended to train than the voice occurred, and I tried to prevent him, sayingJust as you were speaking my spirit-voice has occurred:  no, you must not train.

Now, why on earth did Timarchus say that? I will tell you. When Timarchus and Philemon,\nson of Philemonides, got up from the wine-party to kill Nicias, son of Heroscamandrus, those two alone had knowledge of the plot;  and Timarchus, as he got up, said to me: What say you, Socrates? Go on drinking, all of you;  I have to get up and go somewhere, but I will join you a little later, if I get the chance. Then occurred that voice of mine, and I said to him: No, no, do not get up;  for my accustomed spiritual sign has occurred to me.\nSo he stopped. Then after an interval of time he again started to go, and said: Well, I am going, Socrates. Again the voice occurred, and so again I constrained him to stop. The third time, wishing to give me the slip, he got up without saying another word to me;  he gave me the slip by watching until my attention was turned elsewhere. Thus it was that he went right off and committed the deed which was the cause of his going then to his death. And hence it was that he spoke those words to his brother which I quoted to you just now, that he was going to his death because he had not taken my advice.\nAnd moreover, in regard to the Sicilian business, many will tell you what I said about the destruction of the army. As to bygones, you may hear from those who know:  but there is an opportunity now of testing the worth of what the sign says. For as the handsome Sannio was setting out on campaign, the sign occurred to me, and he has gone now with Thrasyllus on an expedition bound for  and . I accordingly expect him to be either killed or brought very near it, and I have great fears for our force as a whole.\nNow I have told you all this, because this spiritual power that attends me also exerts itself to the full in my intercourse with those who spend their time with me. To many, indeed, it is adverse, and it is not possible for these to get any good by conversing with me, and I am therefore unable to spend my time in conversing with them. And there are many with whom it does not prohibit my intercourse, yet the intercourse does them no good. But those who are assisted in their intercourse by that spiritual power are the persons whom you have noticed;  for they make rapid progress there and then. And of these, again, who make progress some find the benefit\nboth solid and enduring;  while there are many who, for as long a time as they are with me, make wonderful progress, but when they are parted from me relapse, and are no different from anybody else. This once befell Aristeides, son of Lysimachus, son of Aristeides. For by conversing with me he had made immense progress in a little time;  and then he had to go on an expedition, and he went and sailed away. On his return he found that Thucydides, son of Melesias, son of Thucydides, had been conversing with me. Now Thucydides, the day before, had quarrelled with me\nover some arguments we had had. So when Aristeides saw me, after greeting me and talking of other affairs, he said: But Thucydides, I hear, Socrates, is somewhat on his dignity with you, and is annoyed as though he were somebody. Yes, that is so, I replied. Well, but does he not know, he said, what a sad slave he was, before he associated with you?  It seems not, I replied, upon my soul.  But indeed I myself also, he said, am in a ridiculous position,\nSocrates.  How exactly? I asked. Because, he replied, before I sailed away, I was able to discuss things with anybody, and show myself inferior to none in argument, so that I even sought out the debates of the most accomplished people:  but now, on the contrary, I shun them, wherever I notice there is anyone of education, so ashamed I am of my own ineptitude.  Tell me, I said, did this power forsake you of a sudden, or little by little?  Little by little, he replied. And when it was present with you, I asked,\nwas it present through your having learnt something from me, or in some other way?  I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what is incredible, upon my soul, yet true. For I never yet learnt anything from you, as you know yourself:  but I made progress, whenever I was with you, if I was merely in the same house, without being in the same room, but more progress, when I was in the same room. And it seemed to me to be much more when I was in the same room and looked at you as you were speaking, than when\nI turned my eyes elsewhere:  but my progress was far the greatest and most marked whenever I sat beside you and held and touched you. Now, however, he said, that condition has all oozed away.Such then, Theages, is the intercourse you would have with me:  if God so wills, you will make very great and rapid progress, but otherwise, you will not. Consider, therefore, if it is not safer for you to be educated by one of those persons who have command themselves of the benefit which they bestow on mankind, rather than follow the course on which you may chance with me."}}, {"speaker": "Theages", "p": "Well then, I decide, Socrates, that our plan shall be to make trial of that spiritual sign by associating with each other.

WD 309"}, "#text": "We arrived yesterday evening from the army at , and I sought with delight, after an absence of some time, my wonted conversations.  Accordingly I went into the wrestling-school of Taureas, opposite the Queen's shrine, and there I came upon quite a number of people, some of whom were unknown to me, but most of whom I knew.  And as soon as they saw me\nappear thus unexpectedly, they hailed me from a distance on every side;  but Chaerephon, like the mad creature that he is, jumped up from their midst and ran to me, and grasping me by the handSocrates, he said, how did you survive the battle?  (Shortly before we came away there had been a battle at , of which the people here had only just had news.)In the state in which you see me, I replied.It has been reported here, you know, said he, that the battle was very\nsevere, and that many of our acquaintance have lost their lives in it.Then the report, I replied, is pretty near the truth.You were present, he asked, at the fighting?I was present.Then sit down here, he said, and give us a full account;  for as yet we have had no clear report of it all.  And with that he led me to a seat by Critias, son of Callaeschrus.  So I sat down there and greeted Critias and the rest, and gave them all the news from the battlefield, in answer to their various questions;  each had his inquiry to make.\nWhen we had had enough of such matters, I in my turn began to inquire about affairs at home, how philosophy was doing at present, and whether any of the rising young men had distinguished themselves for wisdom or beauty or both.  Then Critias, looking towards the door,\nfor he saw some young fellows who were coming in with some railing at each other, and a crowd of people following on behind them, saidConcerning the beauties, Socrates, I expect you will get your knowledge at once:  for these who are coming in are in fact forerunners and lovers of the person who is held, for the moment at least, to be the greatest beauty;  and he himself, I imagine, must by now be nearly upon us.Who is he, I asked, and whose son?You must know, he replied, but he was not yet grown up when you went away,Charmides, son of\nour uncle Glaucon, and my cousin.I do know, to be sure, I said;  for he was not to be despised even then, when he was still a child, and now, I suppose, he will be quite a youth by this time.You will know this moment, he said, both how much and to what purpose he has grown.  And just as he spoke these words, Charmides entered.Now I, my good friend, am no measurer:  I am a mere white line in measuring beautiful people, for almost everyone who has just grown up appears beautiful to me.  Nay and this time, moreover, the young man appeared to me\na marvel of stature and beauty;  and all the rest, to my thinking, were in love with him, such was their astonishment and confusion when he came in, and a number of other lovers were following in his train.  On the part of men like us it was not so surprising;  but when I came to observe the boys I noticed that none of them, not even the smallest, had eyes for anything else, but that\nthey all gazed at him as if he were a statue.  Then Chaerephon called me and saidHow does the youth strike you, Socrates?  Has he not a fine face?Immensely so, I replied.Yet if he would consent to strip, he said, you would think he had no face, he has such perfect beauty of form.And these words of Chaerephon were repeated by the rest.  Then,By Heracles! I said, what an irresistible person you make him out to be, if he has but one more thinga little thingbesides.What? said Critias.\nIf in his soul, I replied, he is of good grain.  And I should think, Critias, he ought to be, since he is of your house.Ah, he said, he is right fair and good in that way also.Why then, I said, let us strip that very part of him and view it first, instead of his form;  for anyhow, at that age, I am sure he is quite ready to have a discussion.Very much so, said Critias;  for, I may say, he is in fact\na philosopher, and alsoas others besides himself considerquite a poet.That, my dear Critias, I said, is a gift which your family has had a long while back, through your kinship with Solon.  But why not call the young man here and show him to me?  For surely, even if he were younger still, there could be no discredit in our having a talk with him before you, who are at once his guardian and his cousin.You are quite right he said, and we will call him.\nThereupon he said to his attendant,Boy, call Charmides;  tell him I want him to see a doctor about the ailment with which he told me he was troubled yesterday.  Then, turning to me,You know, he has spoken lately of having a headache, said Critias, on getting up in the morning:  now why should you not represent to him that you know a cure for headache?Why not? I said:  only he must come.Oh, he will be here, he said.And so it was;  for he came, and caused much laughter, because each of us who were seated\nmade room for him by pushing hard at his neighbor so as to have him sitting beside himself, until at either end of the seat one had to stand up, and we tumbled the other off sideways;  and he came and sat down between me and Critias.  But here, my friend, I began to feel perplexed, and my former confidence in looking forward to a quite easy time in talking with him had been knocked out of me.  And when, on Critias telling him that it was I who knew the cure,\nhe gave me such a look with his eyes as passes description, and was just about to plunge into a question, and when all the people in the wrestling-school surged round about us on every sidethen, ah then, my noble friend, I saw inside his cloak and caught fire, and could possess myself no longer;  and I thought none was so wise in love-matters as Cydias, who in speaking of a beautiful boy recommends someone to beware of coming as a fawn before the lion, and being seized as his portion of flesh;  for I too felt\nI had fallen a prey to some such creature.  However, when he had asked me if I knew the cure for headache, I somehow contrived to answer that I knew.Then what is it? he asked.So I told him that the thing itself was a certain leaf, but there was a charm to go with the remedy;  and if one uttered the charm at the moment of its application, the remedy made one perfectly well;  but without the charm there was no efficacy in the leaf.\nThen I will take down the charm, said he, from you in writing.Do you prefer, I asked, to get my consent first, or to do without it?This made him laugh, and he said:  To get your consent, Socrates.Very well, I said;  and are you certain of my name?Unless I misjudge, he replied;  for there is no little talk of you.  among the set of our age, and I remember as a mere child the sight of you in company with Critias here.That is a good thing, I said:  for I shall speak more freely to you\nabout the charm, and its real nature;  just now I was at a loss for the way to apprise you of its power.  For it is of such a nature, Charmides, that it cannot cure the head alone;  I daresay you have yourself sometimes heard good doctors say, you know, when a patient comes to them with a pain in his eyes, that it is not possible for them to attempt a cure of his eyes alone, but that it is necessary to treat his head too at the same time,\nif he is to have his eyes in good order;  and so again, that to expect ever to treat the head by itself, apart from the body as a whole, is utter folly.  And on this principle they apply their regimen to the whole body, and attempt to treat and heal the part along with the whole;  or have you not observed that this is what they say, and is done in fact?Certainly I have, he said.And you consider it well said, and accept the principle?Most assuredly, he said.\nThen I, on hearing his approval, regained my courage;  and little by little I began to muster up my confidence again, and my spirit began to rekindle.  So I said,Such, then, Charmides, is the nature of this charm.  I learnt it on campaign over there, from one of the Thracian physicians of Zalmoxis, who are said even to make one immortal.  This Thracian said that the Greeks were right in advising as I told you just now:  but Zalmoxis, he said,\nour king, who is a god, says that as you ought not to attempt to cure eyes without head, or head without body, so you should not treat body without soul;  and this was the reason why most maladies evaded the physicians of Greecethat they neglected the whole, on which they ought to spend their pains, for if this were out of order it was impossible for the part to be in order.  For all that was good and evil, he said, in the body and in man altogether was sprung from the soul, and flowed along from thence as it did\nfrom the head into the eyes.  Wherefore that part was to be treated first and foremost, if all was to be well with the head and the rest of the body.  And the treatment of the soul, so he said, my wonderful friend, is by means of certain charms, and these charms are words of the right sort:  by the use of such words is temperance engendered in our souls, and as soon as it is engendered and present we may easily secure health to the head and to the rest of the body also.\nNow in teaching me the remedy and the charms he remarked, Let nobody persuade you to treat his head with this remedy, unless he has first submitted his soul for you to treat with the charm.  For at present, he said, the cure of mankind is beset with the error of certain doctors who attempt to practise the one method without the other. And he most particularly enjoined on me not to let anyone, however wealthy or noble or handsome,\ninduce me to disobey him.  So I, since I have given him my oath, and must obey him, will do as he bids;  and if you agree to submit your soul first to the effect of the Thracian charms, according to the stranger's injunctions, I will apply the remedy to your head:  otherwise we shall be at a loss what to do with you, my dear Charmides.Then Critias, when he heard me say this, remarked,This affection of the head, Socrates, will turn out to be a stroke of luck for the young man, if he is to be compelled\non account of his head to improve his understanding also.  However, let me tell you, Charmides is considered to excel his comrades not only in appearance, but also in that very thing which you say is produced by your charm:  temperance, you say it is, do you not?Certainly, I replied.Then be assured, he said, that he is considered to be far and away the most temperate person now alive, while in every other respect, for a youth of his age, he is second to none.Why, yes, I said, and it is only right, Charmides, that you should excel the rest in all these respects; for\nI do not suppose there is anyone else here who could readily point to a case of any two Athenian houses uniting together which would be likely to produce handsomer or nobler offspring than those from which you are sprung.  For your father's house, which comes from Critias, son of Dropides, has been celebrated by Anacreon and Solon and many other poets, so that it is famed by tradition among us as preeminent in beauty and virtue\nand all else that is accounted happiness;  and then, your mother's house is famous in the same way, for of Pyrilampes, your uncle, it is said that no one in all the continent was considered to be his superior in beauty or stature, whenever he came as envoy to the great king or anyone else in , and his house as a whole is no whit inferior to the other.  Sprung from such people, it is to be supposed that you would be first in all things.  And indeed,\nas regards your visible form, dear son of Glaucon, I consider that nowhere have you fallen behind any of your ancestors.  But if your nature is really rich in temperance and those other things, as our friend here says, blessed is the son, dear Charmides, I exclaimed, that your mother has borne in you!  However, the case stands thus:  if you already possess temperance, as Critias here declares, and you are sufficiently temperate, then you never had any need of the charms of Zalmoxis or of Abaris the Hyperborean,\nand might well be given at once the remedy for the head;  but if you prove to be still lacking that virtue, we must apply the charm before the remedy.  So tell me yourself whether you agree with our friend, and can say that you are already sufficiently provided with temperance, or are deficient in it?At this Charmides blushed and, for one thing, looked more beautiful then ever, for his modesty became his years;  and then, too, he answered most ingenuously, saying it was no easy matter at the moment either to admit or to deny the words of the question.  For if,\nhe went on, I say I am not temperate, not only is it a strange thing to say against oneself, but I shall at the same time be taxing with untruth both Critias and many others who consider me to be temperate, as he gives out;  while if, on the other hand, I say I am, and praise myself, it will probably be found distasteful;  so that I cannot see what answer I am to give you.Then I said:  Your answer is a natural one, in my opinion, Charmides;  and I think, I went on, that we must join in inquiring whether you possess the thing I am asking after, or not, in order that\nneither you may be forced to say what you do not wish, nor I on my part may recklessly try my hand at medicine.  So if it is agreeable to you, I am ready to inquire with you;  but, if it is not, to let it alone.Why, nothing, he said, could be more agreeable to me :  so far as that goes, therefore, inquire in whatever way you think we had better proceed.Then this is the way, I said, in which I consider that our inquiry into this matter had best be conducted.  Now, it is clear that, if you\nhave temperance with you, you can hold an opinion about it.  For being in you, I presume it must, in that case, afford some perception from which you can form some opinion of what temperance is, and what kind of thing it is :  do you not think so ?I do, he replied.And since you understand the Greek tongue, I said, you can tell me, I suppose, your view of this particular thought of yours?I daresay, he said.Then in order that we may make a guess whether it is in you or not, tell me, I said, what you say of temperance according to your opinion.\nHe at first hung back, and was not at all willing to answer:  but presently he said that, to his mind, temperance was doing everything orderly and quietlywalking in the streets, talking, and doing everything else of that kind;  and in a word, he said, I think the thing about which you ask may be called quietness.Well, I said, are you right there?  They do say, you know, Charmides, that quiet people are temperate :  so let us see if there is anything in what they say.  Tell me, is not temperance,\nhowever, among the honorable things?To be sure, he said.Well, which is most honorable at the writing master's, to write the same sort of letters quickly or quietly?Quickly.And in reading, to do it quickly or slowly?Quickly.And so, in the same way, to play the lyre quickly, or to wrestle nimbly, is far more honorable than to do it quietly and slowly?Yes.And what of boxing, alone or combined with wrestling? Is it not the same there too?To be sure.And in running and leaping and all activities\nof the body, are not nimble and quick movements accounted honorable, while sluggish and quiet ones are deemed disgraceful?Apparently.So we find, I said, that in the body, at least, it is not quietness, but the greatest quickness and nimbleness that is most honorable, do we not?Certainly.And temperance was an honorable thing?Yes.Then in the body, at least, it is not quietness but quickness that will be the more temperate thing, since temperance is honorable.So it seems, he said.\nWell now, I went on;  in learning, is facility the more honorable, or difficulty?Facility.And facility in learning, I said, is learning quickly, and difficulty in learning is learning quietly and slowly?Yes.And is it not more honorable to teach another quickly and forcibly, rather than quietly and slowly?Yes.Well now, is it more honorable to be reminded and to remember quietly and slowly, or forcibly and quickly?Forcibly, he replied, and quickly.\nAnd is not readiness of mind a sort of nimbleness of the soul, not a quietness?True.And to apprehend what is said, whether at the writing-master's or the lyre-master's or anywhere else, not as quietly as possible, but as quickly, is most honorable?Yes.Well, and in the searchings of the soul, and in deliberation, it is not the quietest person, I imagine, or he who deliberates and discovers with difficulty, that is held worthy of praise, but he who does this most easily and quickly.\nThat is so, he said.Then in all, I said, Charmides, that concerns either our soul or our body, actions of quickness and nimbleness are found to be more honorable than those of slowness and quietness?It looks like it, he said.So temperance cannot be a sort of quietness, nor can the temperate life be quiet, by this argument at least;  since, being temperate, it must be honorable.\nFor we have these two alternatives:  either in no cases, or I should think in very few, can we find that the quiet actions in life are more honorable than the quick and vigorous ones;  or at all events, my friend, if of the more honorable actions there are absolutely as many quiet ones as forcible and quick, not even so will temperance be acting quietly any more than acting forcibly and quickly, either in walking or in talking or in any other sphere;  nor will the quiet life be more temperate than the unquiet;  since\nin our argument we assumed that temperance is an honorable thing, and have found that quick things are just as honorable as quiet things.Your statement, he said, Socrates, seems to me to be correct.Once more then, I went on, Charmides, attend more closely and look into yourself;  reflect on the quality that is given you by the presence of temperance, and what quality it must have to work this effect on you.  Take stock of all this and tell me, like a good, brave fellow, what it appears to you to be.\nHe paused a little, and after a quite manly effort of self-examination:  Well, I think, he said, that temperance makes men ashamed or bashful, and that temperance is the same as modesty.Well now, I asked, did you not admit a moment ago that temperance is honorable?Certainly I did, he said.And temperate men are also good?Yes.Well, can that be good which does not produce good men?No, indeed.And we conclude that it is not only honorable, but good also.\n    I think so.Well then, I said, are you not convinced that Homer is right in sayingI am, he said.Then it would seem that modesty is not good, and good.Apparently.But temperance is good, if its presence makes men good, and not bad.It certainly seems to me to be as you say.So temperance cannot be modesty, if it\nis in fact good, while modesty is no more good than evil.Why, I think, he said, Socrates, that is correctly stated;  but there is another view of temperance on which I would like to have your opinion.  I remembered just now what I once heard someone say, that temperance might be doing one's own business.  I ask you, then, do you think he is right in saying this?You rascal, I said, you have heard it from Critias here,\nor some other of our wise men!Seemingly, said Critias, from some other;  for indeed he did not from me.But what does it matter, Socrates, said Charmides, from whom I heard it?Not at all, I replied;  for in any case we have not to consider who said it, but whether it is a true saying or no.Now you speak rightly, he said.Yes, on my word, I said:  but I shall be surprised if we can find out how it stands;  for it looks like a kind of riddle.Why so? he asked.Because, I replied, presumably the speaker of the words\ntemperance is doing one's own business did not mean them quite as he spoke them.  Or do you consider that the scribe does nothing when he writes or reads?I rather consider that he does something, he replied.  And does the scribe, in your opinion, write and read his own name only, and teach you boys to do the same with yours? Or did you write your enemies' names just as much as your own and your friends'?Just as much.Well, were you meddlesome or intemperate\nin doing this?Not at all.And you know you were not doing your own business, if writing and reading are doing something.Why, so they are.And indeed medical work, my good friend, and building and weaving and producing anything whatever that is the work of any art, I presume is doing something.Certainly.Well then, I went on, do you think a state would be well conducted under a law which enjoined that everyone should weave and scour his own coat, and make his own shoes, and his own flask and scraper,\nand everything else on the same principle of not touching the affairs of others but performing and doing his own for himself?I think not, he replied.But still, I said, a state whose conduct is temperate will be well conducted.Of course, he said.Then doing one's own business in that sense and in that way will not be temperance.Apparently not.So that person was riddling, it seems, just as I said a moment ago, when he said that doing one's own business is temperance.  For I take it he was not such a fool as all that:  or was it some idiot\nthat you heard saying this, Charmides?Far from it, he replied, for indeed he seemed to be very wise.Then it is perfectly certain, in my opinion, that he propounded it as a riddle, in view of the difficulty of understanding what doing one's own business can mean.I daresay, he said.Well, what can it mean, this doing one's own business? Can you tell me?I do not know, upon my word, he replied:  but I daresay it may be that not even he who said it knew in the least what he meant.  And as he said this he gave a sly laugh and glanced at Critias.\nNow Critias for some time had been plainly burning with anxiety to distinguish himself in the eyes of Charmides and the company, and having with difficulty restrained himself heretofore, he now could do so no longer;  for I believe that what I had supposed was perfectly truethat Charmides had heard this answer about temperance from Critias.  And so Charmides, wishing him to make answer\ninstead of himself, sought to stir him up in particular, and pointed out that he himself had been refuted;  but Critias rebelled against it, and seemed to me to have got angry with him, as a poet does with an actor who mishandles his verses on the stage:  so he looked hard at him and said:  Do you really suppose, Charmides, that if you do not know what can have been the meaning of the man who said that temperance was doing one's own business, he did not know either?Why, my excellent Critias, I said, no wonder if our friend, at his age, cannot understand;  but you,\nI should think, may be expected to know, in view of your years and your studies.  So if you concede that temperance is what he says, and you accept the statement, for my part I would greatly prefer to have you as partner in the inquiry as to whether this saying is true or not.Well, I quite concede it, he said, and accept it.That is good, then, I said.  Now tell me, do you also concede what I was asking just nowthat all craftsmen make something?I do.And do you consider that they make their own things only, or those of others also?\nThose of others also.And are they temperate in not making their own things only?Yes:  what reason is there against it? he said.None for me, I replied;  but there may be for him who, after assuming that temperance is doing one's own business, proceeds to say there is no reason against those also who do others' business being temperate.And have I, pray, he said, admitted that those who do others' business are temperate? Or was my admission of those who make things?Tell me, I said, do you not call making and doing the same?\nNo indeed, he replied, nor working and making the same either:  this I learnt from Hesiod, who said,   Now, do you suppose that if he had given the names of working and doing to such works as you were mentioning just now, he would have said there was no reproach in shoe-making or pickle-selling or serving the stews?  It is not to be thought, Socrates;  he rather held,\nI conceive, that making was different from doing and working, and that while a thing made might be a reproach if it had no connection with the honorable, work could never be a reproach.  For things honorably and usefully made he called works, and such makings he called workings and doings;  and we must suppose that it was only such things as these that he called our proper concerns, but all that was harmful, the concerns of others.  So that we must conclude that Hesiod, and anyone else of good sense, calls him temperate who does his own business.\nAh, Critias, I said, you had hardly begun, when I grasped the purport of your speechthat you called one's proper and one's own things good, and that the makings of the good you called doings;  for in fact I have heard Prodicus drawing innumerable distinctions between names. Well, I will allow you any application of a name that you please;  only make clear to what thing it is that you attach such-and-such a name.  So begin now over again, and define more plainly.\nDo you say that this doing or making, or whatever is the term you prefer, of good things, is temperance?I do, he replied.Then not he who does evil, but he who does good, is temperate?And do not you, my excellent friend, he said, think so?Leave that aside, I said;  for we have not to consider yet what I think, but what you say now.Well, all the same, I say, he replied, that he who does evil instead of good is not temperate, whereas he who does good instead of evil is temperate :  for I give you the doing of good things is temperance as my plain definition.\nAnd there is no reason, I daresay, why your statement should not be right;  but still I wonder, I went on, whether you judge that temperate men are ignorant of their temperance.No, I do not, he said.A little while ago, I said, were you not saying that there was no reason why craftsmen should not be temperate in making others' things as well?Yes, I was, he said, but what of it ?Nothing;  only tell me whether you think that a doctor, in making someone healthy,\nmakes a helpful result both for himself and for the person whom he cures.I do.And he who does this does his duty?Yes.Is not he who does his duty temperate?Indeed he is.Well, and must the doctor know when his medicine will be helpful, and when not? And must every craftsman know when he is likely to be benefited by the work he does, and when not?Probably not.Then sometimes, I went on, the doctor may have done what is helpful\nor harmful without knowing the effect of his own action;  and yet, in doing what was helpful, by your statement, he has done temperately.  Or did you not state that?I did.Then it would seem that in doing what is helpful he may sometimes do temperately and be temperate, but be ignorant of his own temperance?But that, he said, Socrates, could never be:  if you think this in any way a necessary inference from my previous admissions,\nI would rather withdraw some of them, and not be ashamed to say my statements were wrong, than concede at any time that a man who is ignorant of himself is temperate.  For I would almost say that this very thing, self-knowledge, is temperance, and I am at one with him who put up the inscription of those words at .  For the purpose of that inscription on the temple, as it seems to me, is to serve as the god's salutation to those who enter it, instead of\nHail!this is a wrong form of greeting, and they should rather exhort one another with the words, Be temperate! And thus the god addresses those who are entering his temple in a mode which differs from that of men;  such was the intention of the dedicator of the inscription in putting it up, I believe;  and that he says to each man who enters, in reality,   But he says it in a rather riddling fashion, as a prophet would;  for Know thyself! and Be temperate! are the same, as\nthe inscription and I declare, though one is likely enough to think them differentan error into which I consider the dedicators of the later inscriptions fell when they put up  and  For they supposed that  was a piece of advice, and not the god's salutation of those who were entering;  and so, in order that their dedications too might equally give pieces of useful advice, they wrote these words and dedicated them.  Now my object in saying all this, Socrates, is to abandon to you all the previous argument\nfor, though perhaps it was you who were more in the right, or perhaps it was I, yet nothing at all certain emerged from our statementsand to proceed instead to satisfy you of this truth, if you do not admit it, that temperance is knowing oneself.Why, Critias, I said, you treat me as though I professed to know the things on which I ask questions, and needed only the will to agree with you.  But the fact of the matter is rather that I join you in the inquiry, each time that a proposition is made, because I myself do not know;  I wish therefore to consider first,\nbefore I tell you whether I agree or not.  Now, give me a moment to consider.Consider then, he said.Yes, and I am considering, I said.  For if temperance is knowing anything, obviously it must be a kind of science, and a science of something, must it not?It is, he replied, and of itself.And medicine, I said, is a science of health?Certainly.Then if you should ask me, I said, wherein medicine, as a science of health, is useful to us, and what it produces,\nI should say it is of very great benefit, since it produces health;  an excellent result, if you allow so much.I allow it.And so, if you should ask me what result I take to be produced by building, as the builder's science, I should say houses;  and it would be the same with the other arts.  Now it is for you, in your turn, to find an answer to a question regarding temperancesince you say it is a science of self, Critiasand to tell me what excellent result it produces for us,\nas science of self, and what it does that is worthy of its name.  Come now, tell me.But, Socrates, he said, you are not inquiring rightly.  For in its nature it is not like the other sciences, any more than any of them is like any other;  whereas you are making your inquiry as though they were alike.  For tell me, he said, what result is there of the arts of reckoning and geometry, in the way that a house is of building, or a coat of weaving, or other products of the sort that one might point to\nin various arts? Well, can you, for your part, point to any such product in those two cases? You cannot.To this I replied:  What you say is true;  but I can point out to you what is the peculiar subject of each of these sciences, distinct in each case from the science itself.  Thus reckoning, I suppose, is concerned with the even and the odd in their numerical relations to themselves and to one another, is it not?Certainly, he said.And you grant that the odd and the even are different from the actual art of reckoning?Of course.\nAnd once more, weighing is concerned with the heavier and the lighter weight;  but the heavy and the light are different from the actual art of weighing:  you agree?I do.Then tell me, what is that of which temperance is the science, differing from temperance itself?There you are, Socrates, he said:  you push your investigation up to the real question at issuein what temperance differs from all the other sciencesbut you then proceed to seek some resemblance between it\nand them;  whereas there is no such thing, for while all the rest of the sciences have something other than themselves as their subject, this one alone is a science of the other sciences and of its own self.  And of this you are far from being unconscious, since in fact, as I believe, you are doing the very thing you denied you were doing just now:  for you are attempting to refute me, without troubling to follow the subject of our discussion.How can you think, I said, if my main effort is to refute you, that I do it with any other motive than that which\nwould impel me to investigate the meaning of my own wordsfrom a fear of carelessly supposing, at any moment, that I knew something while I knew it not?  And so it is now:  that is what I am doing, I tell you.  I am examining the argument mainly for my own sake, but also, perhaps, for that of my other intimates.  Or do you not think it is for the common good, almost, of all men, that the truth about everything there is should be discovered?Yes indeed, he replied, I do, Socrates.Then take heart, I said, my admirable friend, and answer the question put to you as you deem the case to be, without caring a jot\nwhether it is Critias or Socrates who is being refuted:  give the argument itself your attention, and observe what will become of it under the test of refutation.Well, he said, I will do so;  for I think there is a good deal in what you say.Then tell me, I said, what you mean in regard to temperance.Why, I mean, he said, that it alone of all the sciences is the science both of itself and of the other sciences.So then, I said, it will be the science of the lack of science also, besides being the science of science?Certainly, he replied.\nThen only the temperate person will know himself, and be able to discern what he really knows and does not know, and have the power of judging what other people likewise know and think they know, in cases where they do know, and again, what they think they know, without knowing it;  everyone else will be unable.  And so this is being temperate, or temperance, and knowing oneselfthat one should know what one knows and what one does not know.  Is that what you mean?It is, he replied.Once more then, I said, as our third offering to the Saviour,\nlet us consider afresh, in the first place, whether such a thing as this is possible or notto know that one knows, and does not know, what one knows and what one does not know;  and secondly, if this is perfectly possible, what benefit we get by knowing it.We must indeed consider, he said.Come then, I said, Critias, consider if you can show yourself any more resourceful than I am;  for I am at a loss.  Shall I explain to you in what way?By all means, he replied.Well, I said, what all this comes to, if your last statement was correct, is merely that there is one science which\nis precisely a science of itself and of the other sciences, and moreover is a science of the lack of science at the same time.Certainly.Then mark what a strange statement it is that we are attempting to make, my friend:  for if you will consider it as applied to other cases, you will surely seeso I believeits impossibility.How so? In what cases?In the following:  ask yourself if you think there is a sort of vision which is not the vision of things that we see in the ordinary way, but a vision of itself and of the other sorts of vision,\nand of the lack of vision likewise;  which, while being vision, sees no color, but only itself and the other sorts of vision.  Do you think there is any such?Upon my word, I do not.And what do you say to a sort of hearing which hears not a single sound, but hears itself and the other sorts of hearing and lack of hearing?I reject that also.Then take all the senses together as a whole, and consider if you think there is any sense of the senses and of itself, but insensible of any of the things of which the other senses are sensible.I do not.\nNow, do you think there is any desire which is the desire, not of any pleasure, but of itself and of the other desires ?No, indeed.Nor, again, is there a wish, I imagine, that wishes no good, but wishes itself and the other wishes.Quite so;  there is not.And would you say there is any love of such a sort that it is actually a love of no beauty, but of itself and of the other loves?Not I, he replied.And have you ever observed any fear which fears itself\nand the other fears, but has no fear of a single dreadful thing?No, I have not, he replied.Or an opinion which is an opinion of opinions and of itself, but without any opinion such as the other opinions have?By no means.But it is apparently a science of this kind that we are assumingone that is a science of no branch of study, but a science of itself and of the other sciences.So we are.And it is a strange thing, if it really exists?  For we should not affirm as yet that it does not exist, but should still consider whether it does exist.\nYou are right.Well now, this science is a science of something, that is, it has a certain faculty whereby it can be a science of something, has it not?Certainly.For, you know, we say the greater has a certain faculty whereby it can be greater than something?Quite so.That is, than something smaller, if it is to be greater.Necessarily.So if we could find a greater which is greater than other greater things, and than itself, but not greater than the things\nbeside which the others are greater, I take it there can be no doubt that it would be in the situation of being, if greater than itself, at the same time smaller than itself, would it not?Most inevitably, Socrates, he said.Or again, if there is a double of other doubles and of itself, both it and the others must of course be halves, if it is to be their double;  for, you know, a double cannot be of anything else than its half.True.And what is more than itself will also be less, and the heavier will be lighter, and the older\nyounger, and so on with everything else:  whatever has its own faculty applied to itself will have also the natural quality to which its faculty was applicable, will it not? For instance, hearing is, as we say, just a hearing of sound, is it not?Yes.So if it is to hear itself, it will hear a sound of its own;  for it would not hear otherwise.Most inevitably.And sight, I suppose, my excellent friend, if it is to see itself, must needs have a color;  for sight\ncan never see what is colorless.No more it can.Then do you perceive, Critias, in the various cases we have propounded, how some of them strike us as absolutely impossible, while others raise serious doubts as to the faculty of the thing being ever applicable to itself?  For with magnitudes, numbers, and the like it is absolutely impossible, is it not?Certainly.But again, with hearing and sight, or in the further bases of motion moving itself and heat burning itself, and all other\nactions of the sort, the fact must appear incredible to some, but perhaps not to others.  So what we want, my friend, is some great man who will determine to our satisfaction in every respect whether there is nothing in nature so constituted as to have its own faculty applicable to itself, and not only some other object, or whether there are some such, and others not such;  and whether, again, if there are things that have such relation to themselves, they include a science which we assert to be temperance.  For my part, I distrust my own competence to determine these questions, and hence I am neither able to affirm whether it is possible\nthat there should be a science of science, nor willing, let it be ever so true, to acknowledge this to be temperance until I have made out whether such a thing as this would benefit us or not.  For, you see, I have a presentiment that temperance is something beneficial and good;  and you, therefore, son of Callaeschrussince you lay it down that temperance is this very science of science, and moreover of the lack of scienceshall first indicate the possibility, as I put it just now, and then the benefit added to the possibility, of such a thing;\nand perhaps you will then satisfy me that your definition of temperance is correct.Now when Critias heard this and saw me in a difficulty, he seemed to mejust as the sight of someone yawning opposite causes people to be affected in the same wayto be compelled by the sense of my difficulty to be caught in a difficulty himself.  And so, since he usually contrived to distinguish himself, he was too ashamed to bring himself to admit to me before the company that he was unable to determine the questions\nwith which I challenged him, and he made a very indistinct reply in order to conceal his difficulty.  Then I, to forward the discussion, remarked:  Well, if you prefer, Critias, let us concede for the moment that there may possibly be a science of science :  some other time we shall consider whether such is the fact or not.  Come then;  suppose it is perfectly possible:  how is one helped thereby to know what one knows and does not know?  For this, you are aware, we said was the meaning of self-knowledge and temperance, did we not?Certainly, he said;  and it must surely follow, Socrates;\nfor if a man has a science which knows itself, he will be similar himself to that which he has.  For instance, he who has swiftness will be swift, he who has beauty will be beautiful, and he who has knowledge will know;  and when he has knowledge that is of itself, he will then, surely, be in the position of knowing himself.I do not dispute, I said, that when a man has that which knows itself he will know himself;  but having that, how is he bound to know what he knows and what he does not know?\nBecause, Socrates, the two things are the same.I daresay, I said;  but I am afraid I am still my old self:  I still do not see how knowing what one knows and does not know is the same as the other.How do you mean? he asked.In this way, I replied: will a science of science, if such exists, be able to do more than determine that one of two things is science, and the other is not science?No, only that.\nNow, is science or lack of science of health the same as science or lack of science of justice?By no means.For the one, I suppose, is medicine, and the other politics, while the thing in question is merely science.Yes, to be sure.And if a man has no added knowledge of health and justice, but knows only science, as having science of that alone, he will probably know that he has a certain piece of scientific knowledge about himself and about other people, will he not?Yes.\nBut how will this science help him to know what he knows?  For of course he knows health by means of medicine, not temperance, and harmony by means of music, not temperance, and building by means of the builder's art, not temperance;  and so it will be in every case, will it not?Apparently.And how will temperance, supposing it is only a science of sciences, help him to know that he knows health, or that he knows building?By no means.Then he who is ignorant of all this will not know what he knows, but only that he knows.So it seems.\nThen being temperate, or temperance, will not be this knowledge of what one knows or does not know, but, it would seem, merely knowing that one knows or does not know.It looks like it.Then such a person will also be unable to examine another man's claim to some knowledge, and make out whether he knows or does not know what he says he knows:  he will merely know, it would seem, that he has a certain knowledge;  but of what it is, temperance will not cause him to know.Apparently not.\nSo he will be able to distinguish neither the man who pretends to be a doctor, but is none, from the man who really is one, nor any other man who has knowledge from him who has none.  But let us consider it another way:  if the temperate man or anybody else would discriminate between the true doctor and the false, he will go to work thus, will he not?  He will surely not talk to him about medicine;  for, as we were saying, the doctor understands nothing else but health and disease.  Is not that so?Yes, it is.But about science he knows nothing, for that, you know, we assigned to temperance alone.Yes.So the medical man knows nothing about medicine either, since\nmedicine is, of course, a science.True.Then the temperate man will know, indeed, that the doctor has a certain science;  but when he has to put its nature to the proof, must he not consider what its subjects are?  Is not each science marked out, not merely as a science, but as a particular one, by the particular subjects it has?It is, to be sure.And medicine is marked out as different from the other sciences by being a science of health and disease.Yes.And so anyone who wishes to inquire into medicine\nmust make those things, whatever they may be, with which it is concerned, the matter of his inquiry;  not those foreign things, I presume, with which it is not?No, indeed.Then he who conducts his inquiry aright will consider the doctor, as a medical man, in connection with cases of health and disease.So it seems.And will inquire whether, in what is said or done in such cases, his words are truly spoken, and his acts rightly done?He must.Well now, could anyone follow up either of these points without the medical art?No, indeed.\nNobody at all, it would seem, but a doctor;  and so not the temperate man either:  for he would have to be a doctor, in addition to his temperance.That is so.Then inevitably, if temperance is only a science of science and of lack of science, it will be equally unable to distinguish a doctor who knows the business of his art from one who does not know but pretends or thinks he does, and any other person who has knowledge of anything at all:  one will only distinguish one's fellow-artist, as craftsmen usually can.Apparently, he said.\nThen what benefit, I asked, Critias, can we still look for from temperance, if it is like that?  For if, as we began by assuming, the temperate man knew what he knew and what he did not know, and that he knows the one and does not know the other, and if he were able to observe this same condition in bother man, it would be vastly to our benefit, we agree, to be temperate;  since we should pass all our lives, both we who had temperance and all the rest who were governed by us,\nwithout error.  For neither should we ourselves attempt to do what we did not know, instead of finding out those who knew and placing the matter in their hands, nor should we permit others under our governance to do anything but what they were likely to do aright;  and they would do that when they had knowledge of it;  and so it would be that a house which was ordered, or a state which was administered, as temperance bade, and everything else\nthat was ruled by temperance, could not but be well ordered;  for with error abolished, and rightness leading, in their every action men would be bound to do honorably and well under such conditions, and those who did well would be happy.  Did we not so speak of temperance, I said, Critias, when we remarked how great a boon it was to know what one knows and what one does not know?To be sure we did, he replied.Whereas now, I went on, you see that nowhere can any such science be found.I see, he said.\nThen may we say, I asked, that there is this good point in the knowledge of knowledge and of lack of knowledge, which we now find to be what temperance is, that he who has it will not only learn more easily whatever he learns, but will perceive everything more plainly, since besides the particular things that he learns he will behold the science;  and hence he will probe more surely the state of other men respecting the things which he has learnt himself, while those who probe without such knowledge will do it more feebly and poorly?  Are these, my friend, the kind of advantages that we shall gain\nfrom temperance?  But are we really looking at something greater, and requiring it to be something greater than it really is?Probably, he replied, that is so.I daresay, I said;  and I daresay also our inquiry has been worthless.  And this I conclude, because I observe certain strange facts about temperance, if it is anything like that.  For suppose, if you please, we concede that there may possibly be a science of science, and let us grant, and not withdraw, our original proposition that temperance is the knowledge of what one knows and does not know;\ngranting all this, let us still more thoroughly inquire whether on these terms it will be of any profit to us.  For our suggestion just now, that temperance of that sort, as our guide in ordering house or state, must be a great boon, was not, to my thinking, Critias, a proper admission.How so? he asked.Because, I replied, we too tightly admitted that it would be a great boon to mankind if each of us should do what he knows, but should place what he did not know in the hands of others who had the knowledge.\nWell, was that, he asked, not a proper admission?Not to my mind, I answered.In very truth, your words are strange!  he said, Socrates.Yes, by the Dog, I said, and they strike me too in the same way;  and it was in view of this, just now, that I spoke of strange results that I noticed, and said I feared we were not inquiring rightly.  For in truth, let temperance be ever so much what we say it is, I see nothing\nto show what good effect it has on us.How so? he asked:  tell us, in order that we on our side may know what you mean.I expect, I said, I am talking nonsense:  but still one is bound to consider what occurs to one, and not idly ignore it, if one has even a little concern for oneself.And you are quite right, he said.Hear then, I said, my dream, whether it has come through horn or through ivory. Suppose that temperance were such as we now define her,\nand that she had entire control of us:  must it not be that every act would be done according to the sciences, and no one professing to be a pilot when he was not would deceive us, nor would a doctor, nor a general, nor anyone else pretending to know something he did not know, go undetected;  and would not these conditions result in our having greater bodily health than we have now, safety in perils of the sea and war, and skilful workmanship in all our utensils, our clothes,\nour shoes, nay, everything about us, and various things besides, because we should be employing genuine craftsmen?  And if you liked, we might concede that prophecy, as the knowledge of what is to be, and temperance directing her, will deter the charlatans, and establish the true prophets as our prognosticators.  Thus equipped, the human race would indeed act and live\naccording to knowledge, I grant you (for temperance, on the watch, would not suffer ignorance to foist herself in and take a hand in our labors), but that by acting according to knowledge we should do well and be happythis is a point which as yet we are unable to make out, my dear Critias.But still, he replied, you will have some difficulty in finding any other fulfillment of welfare if you reject the rule of knowledge.Then inform me further, I said, on one more little matter.  Of what is this knowledge? Do you mean of shoe-making?\nGood heavens, not I!Well, of working in brass?By no means.Well, in wool, or in wood, or in something else of that sort?No, indeed.Then we no longer hold, I said, to the statement that he who lives according to knowledge is happy;  for these workers, though they live according to knowledge, are not acknowledged by you to be happy:  you rather delimit the happy man, it seems to me, as one who lives according to knowledge about certain things.  And I daresay you are referring to my instance of a moment ago, the man who knows\nall that is to come, the prophet.  Do you refer to him or to someone else?Yes, I refer to him, he said, and someone else too.Whom? I asked.  Is it the sort of person who might know, besides what is to be, both everything that has been and now is, and might be ignorant of nothing? Let us suppose such a man exists:  you are not going to tell me, I am sure, of anyone alive who is yet more knowing than he.No, indeed.Then there is still one more thing I would fain know:  which of the sciences is it that makes him happy? Or does he owe it to all of them alike?\nBy no means to all alike, he replied.But to which sort most?  One that gives him knowledge of what thing, present, past or future?  Is it that by which he knows draught-playing?Draught-playing indeed! he replied.Well, reckoning?By no means.Well, health?More likely, he said.And that science to which I refer as the most likely, I went on, gives him knowledge of what?Of good, he replied, and of evil.Vile creature!  I said, you have all this time been dragging me round and round, while concealing the fact that the life according to knowledge does not make us do well and be happy, not even\nif it be knowledge of all the other knowledges together, but only if it is of this single one concerning good and evil.  For, Critias, if you choose to take away this science from the whole number of them, will medicine any the less give us health, or shoemaking give us shoes, or weaving provide clothes, or will the pilot's art any the less prevent the loss of life at sea, or the general's in war?None the less, he replied.But, my dear Critias, to have any of these things well\nand beneficially done will be out of our reach if that science is lacking.That is true.And that science, it seems, is not temperance, but one whose business is to benefit us;  for it is not a science of sciences and lack of sciences, but of good and evil:  so that if this is beneficial, temperance must be something else to us.But why, he asked, should not it be beneficial?  For if temperance is above all a science of the sciences,\nand presides too over the other sciences, surely she will govern this science of the good, and so benefit us.And give us health also?  I asked:  will she, and not medicine, do this? And will the several works of the other arts be hers, and not the particular works of each art?  Have we not constantly protested that she is only knowledge of knowledge and of lack of knowledge, and of nothing else?  Is not that so?Apparently it is.Then she will not be a producer of health?No, indeed.\nFor health, we said, belongs to another art, did we not?We did.Nor of benefit, my good friend;  for this work, again, we assigned to another art just now, did we not?Certainly.Then how will temperance be beneficial, if it produces no benefit?By no means, Socrates, as it seems.So do you see, Critias, how all the time I had good reason for my fear, and fair ground for the reproach I made against myself, that my inquiry regarding temperance was worthless? For I cannot think that what is admitted to be the noblest thing in the world\nwould have appeared to us useless if I had been of any use for making a good search.  But now, you see, we are worsted every way, and cannot discover what thing it can possibly be to which the lawgiver gave this name, temperance.  And yet we have conceded many points which were not deducible from our argument.  For you know we conceded that there was a science of science, when the argument was against it and would not agree;  and we further conceded that\nthis science could know the works also of the other sciences, when the argument was against this too, in order to make out that the temperate man had a knowledge of what he knew and did not know, so as to know that he knew the one and did not know the other.  And we made this concession in a really magnificent manner, without considering the impossibility of a man knowing, in some sort of way, things that he does not know at all;  for our admission says that he knows that he does not know them;  and yet, in my opinion, there can be nothing more irrational than this.  Nevertheless, although it has found us so simple-minded\nand tractable, the inquiry remains quite incapable of discovering the truth, but has utterly flouted it by most impudently showing us the inutility of that which we had been ever so long assuming, by our joint admissions and fictions, to be the meaning of temperance.  Now, so far as I am concerned, I am not particularly distressed:  but for your sake, I said, Charmides, I am seriously distressed to think that you, with your goodly form and\nmost temperate soul besides, are to have no profit or advantage from the presence of that temperance in all your life.  And I am still more distressed about the charm which I learnt from the Thracian, that I should have spent so much pains on a lesson which has had such a worthless effect.  Now I really do not think that this can be the case, but rather that I am a poor hand at inquiring;  for temperance I hold to be a great good, and you to be highly blessed,\nif you actually have it.  See now whether you have it, and are in no need of the charm;  for if it is yours, I should rather advise you to regard me as a babbler who is unable to argue out any subject of inquiry whatsoever, and yourself as advancing in happiness as you advance in temperance.Then Charmides said:  Why, upon my word, Socrates, I do not know at all whether I have it or have it not.  For how can I know, when even you two are unable\nto discover what this thing is?so you say, but of this you do not at all convince meand I quite believe, Socrates, that I do need the charm, and for my part I have no objection to being charmed by you every day of my life, until you say I have had enough of the treatment.Very well, said Critias:  now, Charmides, if you do this, it will be a proof to me of your temperanceif you submit to be charmed by Socrates and do not forsake him through thick and thin.Count on me to follow, he said, and not forsake him;\nfor it would ill become me to disobey you, my guardian, and refuse to do your bidding.Well now, he said, I bid you.Then I will do as you say, he replied, and will start this very day.There, there, I said, what are you two plotting to do?Nothing, replied Charmides;  we have made our plot.So you will use force, I said, before even allowing me to make my affidavit?You must expect me to use force, he replied, since he gives me the command:  take counsel, therefore, on your side, as to what you will do\nBut that leaves no room, I said, for counsel;  for if once you set about doing anything and use force, no man alive will be able to withstand you.Then do not you, he said, withstand me.Then I will not withstand you, I replied."}}}, {"@n": "Lach.", "body": {"head": "Laches", "castList": {"castItem": [{"@type": "role", "role": "Lysimachus"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Melesias"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Nicias"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Laches"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Sons of Lysimachus and Melesias"}, {"@type": "role", "role": "Socrates"}]}, "milestone": [{"@unit": "page", "@n": "178"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "178a"}], "sp": [{"speaker": "Lysimachus", "p": {"milestone": [{"@unit": "section", "@n": "178b"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "179"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "179a"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "179b"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "179c"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "179d"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "179e"}, {"@unit": "page", "@n": "180"}, {"@unit": "section", "@n": "180a"}], "note": {"@anchored": "yes", "@resp": "Loeb", "foreign": {"@lang": "greek", "#text": "MEIRA/KION"}, "#text": "applied to youths from 15 to 21."}, "#text": "You have seen the performance of the man fighting in armour, Nicias and Laches;  but my friend Melesias and I did not tell you at the time our reason for requesting you to come and see it with us.  However, we will tell you now;  for we think we should speak our minds freely to friends like you.  Some people, of course, pour ridicule on such appeals, and when consulted for their advice will not say what they think,\nbut something different, making the inquirer's wishes their aim, and speaking against their own judgement.  But you, we consider, not merely have the necessary discernment but will give us the benefit of it in telling us just what is in your minds and hence we have enlisted your counsel on the question which we are about to lay before you.  Now the matter about which I have made all this long preamble is this: \nwe have two sons here, my friend that one, called Thucydides after his grandfather, and I this one;  he also is named in the same way, after my father;  we call him Aristeides.  Well, we have resolved to give them our most constant care, and notas most fathers do when their boys begin to be young menlet them run loose as their fancy leads them, but begin forthwith taking\nevery possible care of them.  Now, knowing that you too have sons, we thought that you above all men must have concerned yourselves with the question of the kind of upbringing that would make the best of them;  and if by any chance you have not given your attention to the subject, we would remind you that it ought not to be neglected, and we invite you to join us in arranging some way of taking care of our sons. How we formed this resolve, Nicias and Laches, is worth hearing, even though the story be somewhat long.  My friend Melesias and I take our meals together,\nand our boys share our table.  Now, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are going to speak quite freely to you.  Each of us has many noble deeds of his own father to relate to these young fellowstheir numerous achievements both in war and in peace, when they were managing the affairs either of the allies or of this city;  but neither of us has any deeds of his own to tell.  We cannot help feeling ashamed that our boys should observe this, and we blame our fathers\nfor leaving us to indulge ourselves when we began to be young men, while they looked after other folks' affairs;  and we point the moral of it all to these young people, telling them that if they are careless of themselves and will not take our advice they will win no reputation, but if they take due pains they may very likely come to be worthy of the names they bear.  Now they, for their part, say they will do as we bid;  so we are now considering what lessons or pursuits will lead them to the highest attainable excellence. Someone directed us to this particular accomplishment\nof fighting in armor, as being an admirable one for a young man to learn;  and he praised that man whose performance you were just watching, and then urged us to go and see him.  So we decided that it would be well to go and see the man ourselves, and to take you along with us not merely as companions at the show, but also as counsellors and copartners, if you will be so good, in the matter of looking after our sons. \nThat is the question which we wanted to discuss with you.  And we look to you now, on your part, to give us your advice, first as to whether you think this accomplishment should be learnt or not, and then as to any other such art or pursuit that you can recommend for a young man;  and also, how you feel inclined as regards our partnership."}}, {"speaker": "Nicias", "p": {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "180b"}, "#text": "For myself, Lysimachus and Melesias, I highly approve of your purpose, and am ready to lend a hand and I may say the same, I think, for Laches here."}}, {"speaker": "Laches", "p": {"milestone": {"@unit": "section", "@n": "180c"}, "#text": "Yes, you think truly, Nicias.

For in my opinion\nthis accomplishment is in many ways a useful thing for young men to possess.  It is good for them, instead of spending their time on the ordinary things to which young men usually give their hours of leisure, to spend it on this, which not only has the necessary effect of improving their bodily health\nsince it is as good and strenuous as any physical exercisebut is also a form of exercise which, with riding, is particularly fitting for a free citizen;  for only the men trained in the use of these warlike implements can claim to be trained in the contest whereof we are athletes and in the affairs wherein we are called upon to contend. Further, this accomplishment will be of some benefit also in actual battle, when it comes to fighting in line with a number of other men;  but its greatest advantage will be felt when the ranks are broken, and you find you must fight man to man, either in pursuing someone who is trying to beat off your attack,\nor in retreating yourself and beating off the attack of another.  Whoever possessed this accomplishment could come to no harm so long as he had but one to deal with, nor yet, perhaps, if he had several;  it would give him an advantage in any situation. Moreover, it is a thing which impels one to desire another noble accomplishment;  for everyone who has learnt how to fight in armor will desire to learn the accomplishment which comes next, the management of troops;  and when he has got that and once taken a pride in his work\nhe will push on to attain the whole art of generalship.  It is evident already that all accomplishments and pursuits in the military sphere are both honourable and valuable to a man, either in acquisition or in practice;  and this particular one may well be an introduction to them.  And we can make this additionno slight oneto its claims, that this science will make any man individually a great deal bolder and braver in war.

And besides,\nif this skill in arms is an accomplishment, as they say who teach it, and as Nicias terms it, it ought to be learnt;  while if it is not an accomplishment, and those who promise to give it are deceiving us, or if it is an accomplishment, but not a very important one, what can be the good of learning it?  I speak of it in this way from the following point of view:  I conceive that if there were anything in it, it would not have been overlooked by the Lacedaemonians, whose only concern in life is to seek out and practise\nwhatever study or pursuit will give them an advantage over others in war.  And if they have overlooked it, at any rate these teachers of it cannot have overlooked the obvious fact that the Lacedaemonians are more intent on such matters than any of the Greeks, and that anybody who won honour among them for this art would amass great riches elsewhere, just as a tragic poet does who has won honor among us.  And for this reason he who thinks himself a good writer of tragedy\ndoes not tour round with his show in a circuit of the outlying Attic towns, but makes a straight line for this place and exhibits to our people, as one might expect. But I notice that these fighters in armour regard  as holy ground where none may tread, and do not step on it even with the tips of their toes, but circle round it and prefer to exhibit to any other people, especially to those who would themselves admit that they were inferior to many in the arts of war.  Furthermore, Lysimachus, I have come across more than a few of these persons\nin actual operations, and I can see their quality.  Indeed, we can estimate it offhand:  for, as though it were of set purpose, not one of these experts in arms has ever yet distinguished himself in war.  And yet in all the other arts, the men who have made a name are to be found among those who have specially pursued one or other of them;  while these persons, apparently, stand out from the rest in this particularly hapless fate of their profession.  Why, this man Stesilaus, whom you watched with me in that great crowd as he gave his performance\nand spoke in those high terms of himself before us, I have watched elsewhere giving a finer entertainment in the form of a very real display that he made against his will.  The ship on which he was serving struck a transport vessel, and he was using in the fight a combination of a scythe and a speara remarkable weapon that suited so remarkable a man.  Well, the story of this fellow's doings is hardly of enough interest in the main, but you must hear the upshot of his device of a scythe fixed to a spear. \nAs he was fighting, it stuck somehow in the other ship's rigging, and held fast;  so Stesilaus pulled at it in the hope of getting it free, but he could not, and the ships were passing by each other.  For the first moments he ran along in his ship holding on to his spear;  but as the other ship sheered off from his and drew him after, still holding the spear, he let it slip through his hand\nuntil he gripped the butt-end of the shaft.  From the crew of the transport there came laughter and clapping at his posture, and when someone aimed a stone at him which hit the deck near his feet, and he let go the spear, the troops on the warship in their turn could no longer restrain their laughter, as they saw the notable scythe-spear dangling from the transport.  Now, there may perhaps be something in this art of theirs, as Nicias argues, but at any rate that is my impression of it, in the cases I have met with.

Or if any of ourselves says he has had no teacher, but has however some works of his own to speak of, and can point out to us what Athenians or strangers, either slaves or freemen, are acknowledged to owe their goodness to him, let him do so.  But if there is nothing of the sort to be found amongst us, let us bid them look elsewhere;  for we cannot run a risk with our good friends' children where we may ruin them, and so bring upon us the most grievous of accusations from our nearest and dearest.  Now I, Lysimachus and Melesias, am the first to avow\nthat I have had no teacher in this respect;  and yet I have longed for such lessons from my youth up.  But I have not the means to pay fees to the sophists, who were the only persons that professed to be able to make me a complete gentleman;  and to this moment I remain powerless to discover the art myself.  But I should not be surprised if Nicias or Laches has discovered or learnt it:  for they have more means at their command to enable them to learn from others, and they are also older, and have had time to discover it.  Indeed, I regard them as able to educate a man; \nfor they would never declare their minds so freely on pursuits that are beneficial or harmful to a youth unless they felt confident that they had the requisite knowledge.  And I have entire confidence in them myself, except that I wondered at their differing from each other.  I therefore make this counter-request of you, Lysimachus:  just as Laches urged you a moment ago not to release me but to ask me questions, so I now call upon you not to release Laches or Nicias, but to question them in these terms:  Socrates says\nthat he has no understanding of the matter, and that he is not competent to decide which of your statements is true;  that he has never been either a discoverer or a learner of anything of the sort.  But you, Laches and Nicias, are each to tell us who is the cleverest person you have heard on the upbringing of youth;  whether you have knowledge of it by learning from someone or by discovering it yourselves;  and if you learnt it, who were your teachers respectively, and\nwhat other colleagues they had:  in order that, if you are not at leisure through the demands of public business, we may go to them and induce them either with gifts or good turns or with both to undertake the care of our and your children together, and so prevent them from turning out knaves and disgracing their ancestors.  But if you have made the grand discovery yourselves, give us an instance to show what other persons you have succeeded in changing, by your care of them, from knaves to honest gentlemen.  For if you are now going to make your first attempt at educating,\nyou must beware lest you try your experiment, not on a corpus vile, but on your sons and the children of your friends, and you prove to be a mere case, as the proverbial saying has it, of starting pottery on a wine-jar.

I tell you, gentlemenand this is confidentialthat we ought all alike to seek out the best teacher we can find, first for ourselvesfor we need oneand then for our boys, sparing neither expense nor anything else we can do:  but to leave ourselves as we now are, this I do not advise.

Then Hippothales, as he saw me approaching, said: Socrates, whither away, and whence?\n From the Academy, I replied, on my way straight to the Lyceum.Come over here, he said, straight to us.  You will not put in here?  But you may as well.Where do you mean?  I asked; and what is your company?Here, he said, showing me there, just opposite the wall, a sort of enclosure and a door standing open.  We pass our time there, he went on;  not only we ourselves, but others besides,a great many, and handsome. \n And what, pray, is this place, and what your pastime?A wrestling school, he said, of recent construction; and our pastime chiefly consists of discussions, in which we should be happy to let you have a share.That is very good of you, I said; and who does the teaching there?Your own comrade, he replied, and supporter, Miccus.Upon my word, I said, he is no slight person, but a qualified professor.Then will you please come in with us, he said, so as to see for yourself the company we have there?\n I should be glad to hear first on what terms I am to enter, and which is the handsome one.Each of us, he replied, has a different fancy, Socrates.Well, and which is yours, Hippothales?  Tell me that.At this question he blushed; so I said: Ah, Hippothales, son of Hieronymus, you need not trouble to tell me whether you are in love with somebody or not: for I know you are not only in love, but also far advanced already in your passion.  In everything else I may be a poor useless creature,\nbut there is one gift that I have somehow from heaven,to be able to recognize quickly a lover or a beloved.When he heard this, he blushed much more than ever.  Then Ctesippus remarked:  Quite charming, the way you blush, Hippothales, and shrink from telling Socrates the name; yet, if he spends but a little time with you, he will find you a regular torment, as he hears you repeat it again and again.  He has deafened our ears, I can tell you, Socrates, by cramming them with Lysis:\nlet him be a trifle in liquor, and as likely as not we start out of our sleep fancying we hear the name of Lysis.  The descriptions he gives us in conversation, though dreadful enough, are not so very bad: it is when he sets about inundating us with his poems and prose compositions.  More dreadful than all, he actually sings about his favorite in an extraordinary voice, which we have the trial of hearing.  And now, at a question from you, he blushes!Lysis apparently, I said, is somebody quite young:\nthis I infer from the fact that I did not recognize the name when I heard it.That is because they do not usually call him by his name, he replied; he still goes by his paternal title, as his father is so very well known.  You must, I am sure, be anything but ignorant of the boy's appearance:  that alone would be enough to know him by.Let me hear, I said, whose son he is.The eldest son, he replied, of Democrates of Aexone.Ah well, I said, Hippothales, what an altogether noble and gallant love you have discovered there!  Now please go on and give me a performance like those that you give your friends here,\nso that I may know whether you understand what a lover ought to say of his favorite to his face or to others.Do you attach any weight, Socrates, he asked, to anything you have heard this fellow say?Tell me, I said; do you deny being in love with the person he mentions?Not I, he replied; but I do deny that I make poems and compositions on my favorite.He is in a bad way, said Ctesippus; why, he raves like a madman!Then I remarked:  Hippothales, I do not want to hear your verses,\nor any ode that you may have indited to the youth; I only ask for their purport, that I may know your manner of dealing with your favorite.I expect this fellow will tell you, he replied:  he has an accurate knowledge and recollection of them, if there is any truth in what he says of my having dinned them so constantly in his ears.Quite so, on my soul, said Ctesippus; and a ridiculous story it is too, Socrates.  To be a lover, and to be singularly intent on one's boy, yet to have nothing particular to tell him that a mere boy could not say, is surely ridiculous:\nbut he only writes and relates things that the whole city sings of, recalling Democrates and the boy's grandfather Lysis and all his ancestors, with their wealth and the horses they kept, and their victories at , the Isthmus, and , with chariot-teams and coursers, and, in addition, even hoarier antiquities than these.  Only two days ago he was recounting to us in some poem of his the entertainment of Hercules,how on account of his kinship with Hercules their forefather welcomed the hero,\nbeing himself the offspring of Zeus and of the daughter of their deme's founder; such old wives' tales, and many more of the sort, Socrates,these are the things he tells and trolls, while compelling us to be his audience.When I heard this I said: Oh, you ridiculous Hippothales, do you compose and chant a triumph song on yourself, before you have won your victory?It is not on myself, Socrates, he replied, that I either compose or chant it.You think not, I said.Then what is the truth of it? he asked.\n Most certainly, I replied, it is you to whom these songs refer.  For if you prevail on your favorite, and he is such as you describe, all that you have spoken and sung will be so much glory to you, and a veritable eulogy upon your triumph in having secured such a favorite as that: whereas if he eludes your grasp, the higher the terms of your eulogy of your favorite, the greater will seem to be the charms and virtues you have lost, and you will be ridiculed accordingly.  Hence anyone who deals wisely in love-matters,\nmy friend, does not praise his beloved until he prevails, for fear of what the future may have in store for him.  And besides, these handsome boys, when so praised and extolled, become full of pride and haughtiness:  do you not think so?I do, he said.And then, the haughtier they are, the harder grows the task of capturing them?Yes, apparently.And what do you think of a hunter who should scare away his quarry in hunting and make it harder to catch?Clearly he would be a poor one.\n And hence to use speech and song, not for charming but for driving wild, would be gross fatuity, would it not?I think so.Then take care, Hippothales, not to make yourself guilty of all these things by your verse-making; and yet I fancy you will not like to allow that a man who damages himself by poetry can be a good poet, so long as he is damaging to himself.On my soul, no, he said; of course it would be most absurd.  But this is the very reason, Socrates, why I impart my feelings to you,\nand ask you for any useful advice you can give as to what conversation or conduct will help to endear one to one's favorite.That is not an easy thing to tell, I replied; but if you will agree to get him to have a talk with me, I daresay I could show you an example of the conversation you should hold with him, instead of those things that your friends say you speak and sing.There is no difficulty about that, he said.  If you will go in with Ctesippus here, and take a seat and talk, I think he will come to you of his own accord; he is singularly fond of listening, Socrates,\nand besides, they are keeping the Hermaea, so that the youths and boys are all mingled together.  So he will come to you but if he does not, Ctesippus is intimate with him, as being a cousin of Menexenus; for Lysis has chosen Menexenus for his particular friend.  So let Ctesippus call him if you find that he does not come of himself.That is what I must do, I said.  Whereupon I took Ctesippus\nwith me into the wrestling school, and the others came after us.  When we got inside, we found that the boys had performed the sacrifice in the place and, as the ceremonial business was now almost over, they were all playing at knuckle-bones and wearing their finest attire.  Most of them were playing in the court out-of-doors; but some were at a game of odd-and-even in a corner of the undressing room, with a great lot of knuckle-bones which they drew from little baskets; and there were others standing about them and looking on.  Among these was Lysis: he stood among the boys\nand youths with a garland on his head, a distinguished figure, deserving not merely the name of well-favored, but also of well-made and well-bred.  As for us, we went and sat apart on the opposite sidefor it was quiet thereand started some talk amongst ourselves.  The result was that Lysis ever and anon turned round to observe us, and was obviously eager to join us.  For a while, however, he hesitated, being too shy to approach us alone;\ntill Menexenus stepped in for a moment from his game in the court and, on seeing me and Ctesippus, came to take a seat beside us.  When Lysis saw him, he came along too and sat down with Menexenus.  Then all the others came to us also; and I must add that Hippothales, when he saw a good many of them standing there, stood so as to be screened by them, in a position where he thought Lysis would not catch sight of him, as he feared that he might irritate him; in this way he stood by and listened.Then I, looking at Menexenus, asked him: Son of Demophon, which is the elder of you two?It is a point in dispute between us, he replied.\n Then you must also be at variance, I said, as to which is the nobler.Yes, to be sure, he said.And moreover, which is the more beautiful, likewise.This made them both laugh.But of course I shall not ask, I said, which of you is the wealthier; for you are friends, are you not?Certainly we are, they replied.And, you know, friends are said to have everything in common, so that here at least there will be no difference between you, if what you say of your friendship is true.They agreed.\n After that I was proceeding to ask them which was the juster and wiser of the two, when I was interrupted by somebody who came and fetched away Menexenus, saying that the wrestling-master was calling him: I understood that he was taking some part in the rites.  So he went off; and then I asked Lysis:  I suppose, Lysis, your father and mother are exceedingly fond of you?  Yes, to be sure, he replied.  Then they would like you to be as happy as possible?\nYes, of course.  Do you consider that a man is happy when enslaved and restricted from doing everything he desires?  Not I, on my word, he said.  Then if your father and mother are fond of you, and desire to see you happy, it is perfectly plain that they are anxious to secure your happiness.  They must be, of course, he said.  Hence they allow you to do what you like, and never scold you, or hinder you from doing what you desire?  Yes, they do, Socrates, I assure you: they stop me from doing a great many things.  How do you mean?  I said: they wish you\nto be happy, and yet hinder you from doing what you like?  But answer me this: suppose you desire to ride in one of your father's chariots and hold the reins in some race; they will not allow you, but will prevent you?  That is so, to be sure, he said; they will not allow me.  But whom would they allow?  There is a driver, in my father's pay.  What do you say?  A hireling, whom they trust rather than you, so that he can do whatever he pleases with the horses; and they pay him besides a salary for doing that!\nWhy, of course, he said.  Well, but they trust you with the control of the mule-cart, and if you wanted to take the whip and lash the team, they would let you?  Nothing of the sort, he said.  Why, I asked, is nobody allowed to lash them?  Oh yes, he said, the muleteer.  Is he a slave, or free?  A slave, he replied.  So it seems that they value a slave more highly than you, their son, and entrust him rather than you with their property,\nand allow him to do what he likes, while preventing you?  And now there is one thing more you must tell me.  Do they let you control your own self, or will they not trust you in that either?  Of course they do not, he replied.  But some one controls you?  Yes, he said, my tutor here.  Is he a slave?  Why, certainly; he belongs to us, he said.  What a strange thing, I exclaimed; a free man controlled by a slave!  But how does this tutor actually exert his control over you?  By taking me to school, I suppose, he replied.  And your schoolmasters, can it be that they also control you?\nI should think they do!  Then quite a large number of masters and controllers are deliberately set over you by your father.  But when you come home to your mother, she surely lets you do what you like, that she may make you happy, either with her wool or her loom, when she is weaving?  I take it she does not prevent you from handling her batten, or her comb, or any other of her wool-work implements.  At this he laughed and said: I promise you, Socrates, not only does she prevent me, but I should get a beating as well,\nif I laid hands on them.  Good heavens!  I said; can it be that you have done your father or mother some wrong?  On my word, no, he replied.Well, what reason can they have for so strangely preventing you from being happy and doing what you like?  Why do they maintain you all day long in constant servitude to somebody, so that, in a word, you do hardly a single thing that you desire?  And thus, it would seem, you get no advantage from all your great possessions\nnay, anyone else controls them rather than younor from your own person, though so well-born, which is also shepherded and managed by another; while you, Lysis, control nobody, and do nothing that you desire.  It is because I am not yet of age, Socrates, he said.  That can hardly be the hindrance, son of Democrates, since there is a certain amount, I imagine, that your father and mother entrust to you without waiting until you come of age.  For when they want some reading or writing done for them, it is you,\nI conceive, whom they appoint to do it before any others of the household.  Is it not so?  Quite so, he replied.  And you are free there to choose which letter you shall write first and which second, and you have a like choice in reading.  And, I suppose, when you take your lyre, neither your father nor your mother prevents you from tightening or slackening what string you please, or from using your finger or your plectrum at will: or do they prevent you?  Oh, no.  Then whatever can be the reason, Lysis, why they do not prevent you here,\nwhile in the matters we were just mentioning they do?  I suppose, he said, because I understand these things, but not those others.  Very well, I said, my excellent friend: so it is not your coming of age that your father is waiting for, as the time for entrusting you with everything; but on the day when he considers you to have a better intelligence than himself, he will entrust you with himself and all that is his.  Yes, I think so, he said.  Very well, I went on, but tell me, does not your neighbor observe the same rule as your father towards you?  Do you think he will entrust you with the management of his house, as soon as he considers you to have a better idea\nof its management than himself, or will he direct it himself?  I should say he would entrust it to me.  Well then, do you not think that the Athenians will entrust you with their affairs, when they perceive that you have sufficient intelligence?  I do.  Ah, do let me ask this, I went on: what, pray, of the Great King?  Would he allow his eldest son, heir-apparent to the throne of , to put what he chose into the royal stew,\nor would he prefer us to do it, supposing we came before him and convinced him that we had a better notion than his son of preparing a tasty dish?  Clearly he would prefer us, he said.  And he would not allow the prince to put in the smallest bit, whereas he would let us have our way even if we wanted to put in salt by the handful.  Why, of course.  Again, if his son has something the matter with his eyes, would he let him meddle with them himself, if he considered him to be no doctor,\nor would he prevent him?  He would prevent him.  But if he supposed us to have medical skill, he would not prevent us, I imagine, even though we wanted to pull the eyes open and sprinkle them with ashes, so long as he believed our judgement to be sound.  That is true.  So he would entrust us, rather than himself or his son, with all his other affairs besides, wherever he felt we were more skilled than they?  Necessarily, he said, Socrates.The case then, my dear Lysis, I said, stands thus: with regard to matters\nin which we become intelligent, every one will entrust us with them, whether Greeks or foreigners, men or women and in such matters we shall do as we please, and nobody will care to obstruct us.  Nay, not only shall we ourselves be free and have control of others in these affairs, but they will also belong to us, since we shall derive advantage from them; whereas in all those for which we have failed to acquire intelligence, so far will anyone be from permitting us to deal with them as we think fit, that everybody will do his utmost to obstruct us\nnot merely strangers, but father and mother and any more intimate person than they; and we on our part shall be subject to others in such matters, which will be no concern of ours, since we shall draw no advantage from them.  Do you agree to this account of the case?  I agree.  Then will anyone count us his friends or have any affection for us in those matters for which we are useless?  Surely not, he said.  So now, you see, your father does not love you, nor does anyone love anyone else, so far as one is useless.  Apparently not, he said.  Then if you can become wise, my boy,\neverybody will be your friend, every one will be intimate with you, since you will be useful and good; otherwise, no one at all, not your father, nor your mother, nor your intimate connections, will be your friends.  Now is it possible, Lysis, to have a high notion of yourself in matters of which you have as yet no notion?  Why, how can I?  he said.  Then if you are in need of a teacher, you have as yet no notion of things?  True.  Nor can you have a great notion of yourself, if you are still notionless.  Upon my word, Socrates, he said, I do not see how I can.\n On hearing him answer this, I glanced at Hippothales, and nearly made a blunder, for it came into my mind to say:  This is the way, Hippothales, in which you should talk to your favorite, humbling and reducing him, instead of puffing him up and spoiling him, as you do now.  Well, I noticed that he was in an agony of embarrassment at what we had been saying, and I remembered how, in standing near, he wished to hide himself from Lysis.\nSo I checked myself and withheld this remark.  In the meantime, Menexenus came back, and sat down by Lysis in the place he had left on going out.  Then Lysis, in a most playful, affectionate manner, unobserved by Menexenus, said softly to me:  Socrates, tell Menexenus what you have been saying to me.To which I replied:  You shall tell it him yourself, Lysis; for you gave it your closest attention.I did, indeed, he said.Then try, I went on, to recollect it as well as you can,\nso that you tell him the whole of it clearly: but if you forget any of it, mind that you ask me for it again when next you meet me.I will do so, Socrates, he said, by all means, I assure you.  But tell him something else, that I may hear it too, until it is time to go home.Well, I must do so, I said, since it is you who bid me.  But be ready to come to my support, in case Menexenus attempts to refute me.  You know what a keen disputant he is.Yes, on my word, very keen; that is why I want you to have a talk with him.\n So that I may make myself ridiculous?  I said.No, no, indeed, he replied I want you to trounce him.How can I?  I asked.  It is not easy, when the fellow is so formidablea pupil of Ctesippus.  And heredo you not see?is Ctesippus himself.Take no heed of anyone, Socrates, he said; just go on and have a talk with him.I must comply, I said.Now, as these words passed between us,What is this feast, said Ctesippus, that you two are having by yourselves, without allowing us a share in your talk?\n Well, well, I replied, we must give you a share.  My friend here fails to understand something that I have been saying, but tells me he thinks Menexenus knows, and he urges me to question him.Why not ask him then?  said he.But I am going to, I replied.  Now please answer, Menexenus, whatever question I may ask you.  There is a certain possession that I have desired from my childhood, as every one does in his own way.  One person wants to get possession of horses,\nanother dogs, another money, and another distinctions:  of these things I reck little, but for the possession of friends I have quite a passionate longing, and would rather obtain a good friend than the best quail or cock in the world; yes, and rather, I swear, than any horse or dog.  I believe, indeed, by the Dog, that rather than all Darius's gold I would choose to gain a dear comradefar sooner than I would Darius himself, so fond I am of my comrades.\nAccordingly, when I see you and Lysis together, I am quite beside myself, and congratulate you on being able, at such an early age, to gain this possession so quickly and easily; since you, Menexenus, have so quickly and surely acquired his friendship, and he likewise yours: whereas I am so far from acquiring such a thing, that I do not even know in what way one person becomes a friend of another, and am constrained to ask you about this very point, in view of your experience.Now tell me: when one person loves another, which of the two becomes friend of the other\nthe loving of the loved, or the loved of the loving?  Or is there no difference?  There is none, he replied, in my opinion.  How is that? I said; do you mean that both become friends mutually, when there is only one loving the other?  Yes, I think so, he replied.  But I ask you, is it not possible for one loving not to be loved by him whom he loves?  It is.  But again, may he not be even hated while loving?  This, I imagine, is the sort of thing that lovers do sometimes seem to incur with their favorites:\nthey love them with all their might, yet they feel either that they are not loved in return, or that they are actually hated.  Or do you not think this is true?  Very true, he replied.  Now in such a case, I went on, the one loves and the other is loved?  Yes.  Which of the two, then, is a friend of the other?  Is the loving a friend of the loved, whether in fact he is loved in return or is even hated, or is the loved a friend of the loving?  Or again, is neither of them in such a case friend of the other, if both do not love mutually?\nAt any rate, he said, it looks as if this were so.  So you see, we now hold a different view from what we held before.  At first we said that if one of them loved, both were friends:  but now, if both do not love, neither is a friend.  It looks like it, he said.  So there is no such thing as a friend for the lover who is not loved in return.  Apparently not.  And so we find no horse-lovers where the horses do not love in return, no quail-lovers, dog-lovers, wine-lovers, or sport-lovers on such terms, nor any lovers of wisdom if she returns not their love.  Or does each person love these things,\nwhile yet failing to make friends of them, and was it a lying poet who saidI do not think so, he said.  But do you think he spoke the truth?  Yes.  Then the loved object is a friend to the lover, it would seem, Menexenus, alike whether it loves or hates: for instance, new-born children,\nwho have either not begun to love, or already hate, if punished by their mother or their father, are yet at that very moment, and in spite of their hate, especially and pre-eminently friends to their parents.  I think, he said, that is the case.  Then this argument shows that it is not the lover who is a friend, but the loved.  Apparently.  And it is the hated who is an enemy, not the hater.  Evidently.  Then people must often be loved by their enemies, and hated by their friends, and be friends to their enemies and enemies to their friends,\nif the loved object is a friend rather than the loving agent.  And yet it is a gross absurdity, my dear friendI should say rather, an impossibilitythat one should be an enemy to one's friend and a friend to one's enemy.  You appear to be right there, Socrates, he said.  Then if that is impossible, it is the loving that must be a friend of the loved.  Evidently.  And so the hating, on the other hand, will be an enemy of the hated.  Necessarily.  Hence in the end we shall find ourselves compelled to agree\nto the same statement as we made before, that frequently a man is a friend of one who is no friend, and frequently even of an enemy, when he loves one who loves not, or even hates; while frequently a man may be an enemy of one who is no enemy or even a friend, when he hates one who hates not, or even loves.  It looks like it, he said.  What then are we to make of it, I asked, if neither the loving are to be friends, nor the loved, nor both the loving and loved together?  For apart from these, are there any others left for us to cite as becoming friends to one another?  For my part, Socrates, he said, I declare I can see no sort of shift.\nCan it be, Menexenus, I asked, that all through there has been something wrong with our inquiry?  I think there has, Socrates, said Lysis, and blushed as soon as he said it; for it struck me that the words escaped him unintentionally, through his closely applying his mind to our talkas he had noticeably done all the time he was listening.So then, as I wanted to give Menexenus a rest, and was delighted with the other's taste for philosophy, I took occasion to shift the discussion over to Lysis, and said:\nLysis, I think your remark is true, that if we were inquiring correctly we could never have gone so sadly astray.  Well, let us follow our present line no further, since our inquiry looks to me a rather hard sort of path: I think we had best make for the point where we turned off,\nand be guided by the poets; for they are our fathers, as it were, and conductors in wisdom.  They, of course, express themselves in no mean sort on the subject of friends, where they happen to be found; even saying that God himself makes them friends by drawing them to each other.  The way they put it, I believe, is something like this:\n and so brings them acquainted; or have you not come across these verses?  Yes, I have, he replied.  And you have also come across those writings of eminent sages, which tell us this very thingthat like must needs be always friend to like?  I refer, of course, to those who debate or write about nature and the universe.  Quite so, he said.  Well now, I went on, are they right in what they say?  Perhaps, he replied.  Perhaps in one half of it, I said; perhaps in even the whole; only we do not comprehend it.  We suppose that the nearer a wicked man\napproaches to a wicked man, and the more he consorts with him, the more hateful he becomes; for he injures him, and we consider it impossible that injurer and injured should be friends.  Is it not so?  Yes, he answered.  On this showing, therefore, half of the saying cannot be true, if the wicked are like one another.  Quite so.  What I believe they mean is that the good are like one another, and are friends, while the badas is also said of themare never like even their own selves,\nbeing so ill-balanced and unsteady; and when a thing is unlike itself and variable it can hardly become like or friend to anything else.  You must surely agree to that?  I do, he said.  Hence I conclude there is a hidden meaning, dear friend, intended by those who say that like is friend to like, namely that the good alone is friend to the good alone, while the bad never enters into true friendship with either good or bad.  Do you agree?  He nodded assent.\nSo now we can tell what friends are; since our argument discloses that they are any persons who may be good.  I quite think so, said he.And I also, said I; and yet there is a point in it that makes me uneasy:  so come, in Heaven's name, let us make out what it is that I suspect. like friend to like in so far as he is like, and is such an one useful to his fellow?  Let me put it another way: when anything whatever is like anything else, what benefit can it offer, or what harm can it do, to its like, which it could not offer or do to itself?  Or what could be done to it that could not be done to it by itself?\nHow can such things be cherished by each other, when they can bring no mutual succor?  Is it at all possible?  No.  And how can that be a friend, which is not cherished?  By no means.  But, granting that like is not friend to like, the good may still be friend to the good in so far as he is good, not as he is like?  Perhaps.  But again, will not the good, in so far as he is good, be in that measure sufficient for himself?  Yes.  And the sufficient has no need of anything,\nby virtue of his sufficiency.  Of course.  And if a man has no need of anything he will not cherish anything.  Presumably not.  And that which does not cherish will not love.  I should think not.  And one who loves not is no friend.  Evidently.  So how can we say that the good will be friends to the good at all, when neither in absence do they long for one anotherfor they are sufficient for themselves even when apartnor in presence have they need of one another?  How can it be contrived that such persons shall value each other highly?  By no means, he said.\nAnd if they do not set a high value on each other, they cannot be friends.  True.Now observe, Lysis, how we are missing the track.  Can it be, indeed, that we are deceived in the whole matter?  How so? he asked.  Once on a time I heard somebody say, and I have just recollected it, that like was most hostile to like, and so were good men to good men; and what is more, he put forward Hesiod as witness, by quoting his words\nand in all other cases it was the same, he said; likest things must needs be filled with envy, contention, and hatred against each other, but the unlikest things with friendship: since the poor man must needs be friendly to the rich, and the weak to the strong, for the sake of assistance, and also the sick man to the doctor; and every ignorant person had to cherish the well-informed, and love him.  And then the speaker pursued his theme to this further and more imposing pointthat like could not in the slightest degree be friendly to like,\nbut was in just the opposite case: for it was between things most opposed that friendship was chiefly to be found, since everything desired its opposite, not its like.  Thus dry desired wet, cold hot, bitter sweet, sharp blunt, empty fullness, full emptiness, and likewise the rest on the same principle: for the opposite was food for its opposite, as the like\ncould have no enjoyment of its like.  And I must say, my good friend, his argument seemed a smart one, for he expressed it well.  But you, I askedhow does it strike you?  It sounds all right, said Menexenus, at least on the moment's hearing.  Then are we to say that the opposite is most friendly to its opposite?  Certainly.  Well, I exclaimed, is it not monstrous, Menexenus?  Why, at once these all-accomplished logic-choppers will delightedly pounce on us and ask whether hatred is not the most opposite thing to friendship.\nAnd what answer shall we give them?  Shall we not be forced to admit that what they say is true?  We shall.  So then, they will demand, is a hating thing friend to the friendly thing, or the friendly to the hating?  Neither, he replied.  But is the just a friend to the unjust, or the temperate to the profligate, or the good to the bad?  I do not think that could be so.  But yet, I urged, if one thing is friend to another on this principle of opposition, these things too must needs be friends.  They must.  So neither is like friend to like, nor opposite friend to opposite.  It seems not.\n But there is still this point to consider; for perhaps we are yet more mistaken, and the friendly has really nothing to do with all this: it may rather be something neither good nor bad that will prove after all to be what we call friend of the good.  How do you mean?  he asked.  For the life of me, I said, I cannot tell: the fact is, I am quite dizzy myself with the puzzle of our argument, and am inclined to agree with the ancient proverb that the beautiful is friendly.  It certainly resembles something soft and smooth and sleek;\nthat is why, I daresay, it so easily slides and dives right into us, by virtue of those qualities.  For I declare that the good is beautiful: do you not agree?  I do.  Then I will be a diviner for once, and state that what is neither good nor bad is friendly to what is beautiful and good; and what it is that prompts me to this divination, you must now hear.  My view is that there are three separate kinds, as it werethe good, the bad, and what is neither good nor bad; and what is yours?  Mine is the same, he replied.\nAnd that neither is the good friendly to the good, nor the bad to the bad, nor the good to the bad; so much our previous argument already forbids.  One view then remains:  if anything is friendly to anything, that which is neither good nor bad is friendly to either the good or what is of the same quality as itself.  For I presume nothing could be found friendly to the bad.  True.  Nor, however, can like be friendly to like: this we stated just now, did we not?  Yes.  So what is neither good nor bad can have no friendship with the same sort of thing as itself.  Apparently not.  Then only what is neither good nor bad proves to be friendly to the good,\nand to that only.  That must be so, it seems.Then can we rely further on this present statement, my boys, I said, as a sure guide?  For instance, we have only to consider a body in health to see that it has no need of doctoring or assistance: it is well enough as it is, and so no one in health is friend to a doctor, on account of his health.  You agree?  Yes.  But the sick man is, I imagine, on account of his disease.  Certainly.  Now disease is a bad thing, and medicine is beneficial and good.  Yes.  And a body, of course, taken as body, is neither good nor bad.\nThat is so.  But a body is compelled by disease to welcome and love medicine.  I think so.  Thus what is neither bad nor good becomes a friend of the good because of the presence of evil.  So it seems.  But clearly this must be before it is itself made evil by the evil which it has; for surely, when once it has been made evil, it can no longer have any desire or love for the good; since we agreed it was impossible\nfor bad to be a friend of good.  Yes, impossible.  Now observe what I say.  Some things are of the same sort as those that are present with them, and some are not.  For example, if you chose to dye something a certain color, the substance of the dye is present, I presume, with the thing dyed.  Certainly.  Then is the thing dyed of the same sort, in point of color, as the substance that is added?  I do not understand, he said.\nWell, try it this way, I went on: suppose some one tinged your golden locks with white lead, would they then be or appear to be white?  Yes, they would so appear, he replied.  And, in fact, whiteness would be present with them?  Yes.  But all the same they would not be any the more white as yet; for though whiteness be present, they are not at all white, any more than they are at all black.  True.  But when, my dear boy, old age has cast that same color upon them, they have then come to be of the same sort as\nthat which is presentwhite through presence of white.  To be sure.  So this is the question I have been trying to put to youwhether a thing that has something present with it is to be held of the same sort as that present thing or only when that thing is present in a particular way, but otherwise not?  More likely the latter, he said.  So that what is neither bad nor good is sometimes, when bad is present, not bad as yet, and such cases have been known to occur.  Certainly.  When therefore it is not bad as yet, though bad is present, this presence makes it desire good; but the presence which makes it bad deprives it equally of its desire and its love for the good.  For it is no longer\nneither bad nor good, but bad; and we found that bad was no friend to good.  No, indeed.  And consequently we may say that those who are already wise no longer love wisdom, whether they be gods or men; nor again can those be lovers of wisdom who are in such ignorance as to be bad: for we know that a bad and stupid man is no lover of wisdom.  And now there remain those who, while possessing this bad thing, ignorance, are not yet made ignorant or stupid, but are still aware of not knowing the things\nthey do not know.  It follows, then, that those who are as yet neither good nor bad are lovers of wisdom, while all who are bad, and all the good, are not: for, as we found in our previous discussion, neither is opposite friend to opposite, nor like to like.  You remember, do you not?  To be sure we do, they both replied.  So now, Lysis and Menexenus, I said, we can count on having discovered what is the friendly and what is not.  For we say that, in the soul\nand the body and everywhere, just that which is neither bad nor good, but has the presence of bad, is thereby friend of the good.  To this statement they said that they entirely agreed.And, beyond that, I was myself filled with delight, like a hunter, at the satisfaction of getting hold of what I was hunting; when somehow or other a most unaccountable suspicion came over me that the conclusion to which we had agreed was not true.  So at once I exclaimed in vexation: Alack-a-day, Lysis and Menexenus!  I fear our new-gotten riches are all a dream.\n How on earth is that?  said Menexenus.I am afraid, I replied, that in our search for friendship we have struck up with arguments that are no better than a set of braggarts.How so ? he asked.Just consider a moment, I said.  When a man is a friend, is he friend to some one or not?  He needs be, he replied.  Then is he so for the sake of nothing and because of nothing, or for the sake of something and because of something?  For the sake of something, and because of something.  Is it a friendthat thing for whose sake he is a friend to his friendor is it neither friend nor foe?  I do not quite follow, he said.\nNaturally enough, said I; but perhaps you will keep up if we try it another way, and I expect that I too will better understand what I am saying.  The sick man, we said just now, is a friend to the doctor; is not that so?  Yes.  Then is it because of disease, for the sake of health, that he is a friend of the doctor?  Yes.  And disease is a bad thing?  Of course.  But what is health? I asked: a good thing, or a bad, or neither?  A good thing, he said.\nAnd we were saying, I believe, that the body, being neither good nor bad, was a friend of medicinethat is, of a good thingbecause of diseasethat is, because of a bad thing; and it is for the sake of health that medicine has acquired this friendship, and health is a good thing.  You agree?  Yes.  Is health a friend or not?  A friend.  And disease is a foe?  Certainly.  So what is neither bad nor good\nis a friend to the good because of what is bad and a foe for the sake of what is good and a friend.  Apparently.  Hence the friend is a friend of its friend for the sake of its friend and because of its foe.  So it seems.Very well, I said: since we have reached this point, my boys, let us take good heed not to be deceived.  I pass over without remark the fact that the friend has become a friend to the friend, and thus the like becomes a friend to the like, which we said was impossible.  There is, however, a further point which we must examine,\nif we are not to find our present argument a mere deception.  Medicine, we say, is a friend for the sake of health.  Yes.  Then is health a friend also?  Certainly.  And if it is a friend, it is so for the sake of something.  Yes.  And that something is a friend, if it is to conform to our previous agreement.  Quite so.  Then will that something be, on its part also, a friend for the sake of a friend?  Yes.  Now are we not bound to weary ourselves with going on in this way, unless we can arrive at some first principle which will not keep leading us on from one friend to another, but will reach the one original friend, for whose sake all the other things can be said\nto be friends?  We must.  So you see what I am afraid ofthat all the other things, which we cited as friends for the sake of that one thing, may be deceiving us like so many phantoms of it, while that original thing may be the veritable friend.  For suppose we view the matter thus: when a man highly values a thing, as in the common case of a father who prizes his son above all his possessions, will such a man, for the sake of placing his son before everything,\nvalue anything else highly at the same time?  For instance, on learning that he had drunk some hemlock, would he value wine highly if he believed it would save his son's life?  Why, of course, he said.  And the vessel too which contained the wine?  Certainly.  Now does he make no distinction in value, at that moment, between a cup of earthenware and his own son, or between three pints of wine and his son?  Or may we perhaps state it thus: all such concern is not entertained for the actual things which are applied for the sake of something, but for that something for whose sake all the rest are applied?\nI know that we often talk of setting great value on gold and silver: but surely we are no nearer the truth of the matter for that; what we rather value above everything is the thingwhatever it may prove to befor whose sake gold and all the other commodities are applied.  May we state it so?  By all means.  Then shall we not give the same account of a friend?  In speaking of all the things that are friends to us\nfor the sake of some other friend, we find ourselves uttering a mere phrase; whereas in reality friend appears to be simply and solely the thing in which all these so-called friendships terminate.  So it appears, he said.  Then the real friend is a friend for the sake of nothing else that is a friend?  True.So we have got rid of this, and it is not for the sake of some friendly thing that the friend is friendly.  But now, is the good a friend?  I should say so.  And further, it is because of the bad that the good is loved;\nlet me state the case as follows:  there are three things of which we have just been speakinggood, bad, and what is neither good nor bad.  If but two of these remained after evil had been cleared away, so that it had no contact with anything, whether body or soul or any of the other things that we count neither bad nor good in themselves, would the result be that good would be of no use to us, but would have become quite a useless thing?  For if there were nothing left to harm us, we should feel no want\nof any assistance; and thus we should have to face the fact that it was because of the bad that we felt such a friendly affection for the good, since the good is a cure for the bad, while the bad is an ailment, and if there is no ailment there is no need for a cure.  Is not this the nature of the goodto be loved because of the bad by us who are midway between the bad and the good, whereas separately and for its own sake it is of no use?  Apparently so, he said.  Then our friend, in which\nall the other things terminatedwe called them friends for the sake of some other friend has no resemblance to these.  For they are described as friends for the sake of a friend: but the real friend appears to have quite the opposite character; for we found if to be a friend for the sake of a foe, and if the foe should be removed we have no friend, it seems, any more.  I should say not, he assented, to judge by our present argument.  Tell me, I beg of you, I went on, if evil is abolished, will it be impossible any longer to feel hunger\nor thirst or other such conditions?  Or will hunger exist, so long as men and animals exist, but without being hurtful?  Thirst, too, and all other desireswill these exist without being bad, because the bad will have been abolished?  Or is this a ridiculous questionas to what will exist or not exist in such a case?  For who can tell?  Yet this, at all events, we do knowthat, as things are now, it is possible for a man to feel hunger as a hurt, and also to be benefited by it.  You agree?  Certainly.  And so, when a man feels thirst or any other desire of the sort,\nhe may have that desire sometimes with benefit, sometimes with harm, and sometimes with neither?  Quite so.  Now if evil things are abolished, is there any reason why the things that are not evil should be abolished along with the evil?  None.  So that those desires which are neither good nor bad will exist even when the bad things are abolished.  Apparently.  Now is it possible for a man, when he desires and loves, to have no friendly feeling towards that which he desires and loves?  I think not.  Thus certain things will continue to be friendly, it seems, when evil things are abolished.  Yes.\nIt cannot be that, if evil were the cause of a thing being friendly, one thing should be friendly to another when evil is abolished.  For when a cause is abolished, that thing can no longer exist, I presume, which had this as its cause.  You are right.  Now we have agreed that the friend has a friendly feeling for something and because of something; and we supposed, just then, that it was because of evil that what was neither good nor bad loved the good.\nTrue.  But now, it seems, we make out a different cause of loving and being loved.  It seems so.  Can it really be then, as we were saying just now, that desire is the cause of friendship, and the desiring thing is a friend to what which it desires, and is so at any time of desiring; while our earlier statement about friends was all mere drivel, like a poem strung out for mere length?  It looks like it, he said.  But still, I went on, the desiring thing desires\nthat in which it is deficient, does it not?  Yes.  And the deficient is a friend to that in which it is deficient?  I suppose so.  And it becomes deficient in that of which it suffers a deprivation.  To be sure.  So it is one's own belongings, it seems, that are the objects of love and friendship and desire; so it appears, Menexenus and Lysis.  They both agreed.  Then if you two are friends to each other by some natural bond you belong to one another.  Precisely, they said.  And in a case where\none person desires another, my boys, or loves him, he would never be desiring or loving or befriending him, unless he somehow belonged to his beloved either in soul, or in some disposition, demeanor or cast of soul.  Yes, to be sure, said Menexenus; but Lysis was silent.  Very well, said I: what belongs to us by nature has been shown to be something we needs must befriend.  It seems so, he said.  Then the genuine, not the pretended, lover must needs be befriended by his favorite.\nTo this Lysis and Menexenus gave but a faint nod of assent; while Hippothales, in his delight, turned all manner of colors.So then, with the design of reviewing the argument, I proceeded: If there is any difference between what belongs and what is like, it seems to me, Lysis and Menexenus, that we might give some account of the meaning of friend.  But if like and belonging are the same, it is not easy to get rid of our former statement, that the like is useless to the like in so far as they have likeness; and to admit that the useless is friendly\nwould be a gross mistake.  So how if we agree now, I said, since our argument has made us quite tipsy, to say that the belonging and the like are two different things?  By all means.  Then shall we maintain that the good itself belongs to every one, while the bad is alien?  Or does the bad belong to the bad, the good to the good, and what is neither good nor bad to what is neither good nor bad?  They agreed that the last three pairs belong together.  So here again, boys,\nI said, we have dropped into the very statements regarding friendship which we rejected at first; for now the unjust will be as much a friend of the unjust, and the bad of the bad, as the good of the good.  So it seems, he said.  And what is more, if we say that the good and the belonging are the same, we cannot avoid making the good a friend only to the good.  To be sure.  But this again, you know, is a view of which we thought we had disabused ourselves; you remember, do you not?  We do.\n So what more can we do with our argument?  Obviously, I think, nothing.  I can only ask you, accordingly, like the professional pleaders in the law courts, to perpend the whole of what has been said.  If neither the loved nor the loving, nor the like nor the unlike, nor the good nor the belonging, nor all the rest that we have tried in turnthey are so many that I, for one, fail to remember any morewell, if none of these is a friend, I am at a loss for anything further to say.\n Having thus spoken, I was minded to stir up somebody else among the older people there; when, like spirits from another world, there came upon us the tutors of Menexenus and Lysis: they were bringing along the boys' brothers, and called out to them the order to go home; for it was getting late.  At first we tried, with the help of the group around us, to drive the tutors off; but they took no notice of us at all, and went on angrily calling, as before, in their foreign accent.  We decided that\nthey had taken a drop too much at the festival and might be awkward customers; so we gave in to them, and broke up our party.  However, just as they were moving off, I remarked: Today, Lysis and Menexenus, we have made ourselves ridiculousI, an old man, as well as you.  For these others will go away and tell how we believe we are friends of one anotherfor I count myself in with youbut what a friend is, we have not yet succeeded in discovering."}}}]}}}}
