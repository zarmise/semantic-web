      "texte": "Son of Cleinias, I think it must surprise you that I, the first of all your lovers, am the only one of them who has not given up his suit and thrown you over, and whereas they have all pestered you with their conversation I have not spoken one word to you for so many years.  The cause of this has been nothing human, but a certain spiritual opposition, of whose power you shall be informed at some later time.  However, it now opposes me no longer,\nso I have accordingly come to you;  and I am in good hopes that it will not oppose me again in the future.  Now I have been observing you all this time, and have formed a pretty good notion of your behavior to your lovers:  for although they were many and high-spirited, everyone of them has found your spirit too strong for him and has run away. \nLet me explain the reason of your spirit being too much for them.  You say you have no need of any man in any matter;  for your resources are so great, beginning with the body and ending with the soul, that you lack nothing.  You think, in the first place, that you are foremost in beauty and statureand you are not mistaken in this, as is plain for all to seeand in the second place, that you are of the most gallant family in your city, the greatest city in , and\nthat there you have, through your father, very many of the best people as your friends and kinsmen, who would assist you in case of need, and other connections also, through your mother, who are not a whit inferior to these, nor fewer.  And you reckon upon a stronger power than all those that I have mentioned, in Pericles, son of Xanthippus, whom your father left as guardian of you and your brother when he died, and who is able to do whatever he likes not only in this city but all over  and among many great nations of the barbarians. \nAnd I will add besides the wealth of your house:  but on this, I observe, you presume least of all.  Well, you puff yourself up on all these advantages, and have overcome your lovers, while they in their inferiority have yielded to your might, and all this has not escaped you;  so I am very sure that you wonder what on earth I mean by not getting rid of my passion, and what can be my hope in remaining when the rest have fled.",

For if I saw you, Alcibiades, content with the things I set forth just now, and minded to pass your life in enjoying them, I should long ago have put away my love,\nso at least I persuade myself:  but as it is, I shall propound to your face quite another set of your thoughts, whereby you will understand that I have had you continually before my mind.  For I believe, if some god should ask you:  Alcibiades, do you prefer to live with your present possessions, or to die immediately if you are not to have the chance of acquiring greater things?  I believe you would choose to die.  But let me tell you what I imagine must be the present hope of your life.  You think that if you come shortly before the Athenian Assemblywhich\nyou expect to occur in a very few daysyou will stand forth and prove to the people that you are more worthy of honor than either Pericles or anyone else who has ever existed, and that having proved this you will have the greatest power in the state;  and that if you are the greatest here, you will be the same among all the other Greeks, and not only Greeks, but all the barbarians who inhabit the same continent with us.  And if that same god should say to you again, that you are to hold sway here in ,\nbut are not to be allowed to cross over into  and to interfere with the affairs of that region, I believe you would be equally loth to live on those sole conditions eitherif you are not to fill, one may say, the whole world with your name and your power;  and I fancy that, except Cyrus and Xerxes, you think there has never existed a single man who was of any account.  So then that this is your hope, I know well enough;  I am not merely guessing.  And I daresay you will reply, since you know that what I say is true:  Well,\nSocrates, and what has that to do with your point?  I am going to tell you, dear son of Cleinias and Deinomache.  Without me it is impossible for all those designs of yours to be crowned with achievement;  so great is the power I conceive myself to have over your affairs and over you, and it is for this very reason, I believe, that the god has so long prevented me from talking with you, and I was waiting to see when he would allow me.  For as\nyou have hopes of proving yourself in public to be invaluable to the state and, having proved it, of winning forthwith unlimited power, so do I hope to win supreme power over you by proving that I am invaluable to you, and that neither guardian nor kinsman nor anyone else is competent to transmit to you the power that you long for except me, with the god's help, however.  In your younger days, to be sure, before you had built such high hopes, the god, as I believe, prevented me from talking with you, in order that I might not waste my words:  but now he has set me on; \nfor now you will listen to me.",

      "Loc": "121b",
      "texte": "Yes, and mine, noble Alcibiades, to Daedalus, and Daedalus to Hephaestus, son of Zeus!  But take the lines of those people, going back from them:  you have a succession of kings reaching to Zeuson the one hand, kings of  and ;  on the other, of , which they have always ruled, and frequently  also, as at present;  whereas we are private persons ourselves, and so were our fathers.  And then,\nsuppose that you had to make what show you could of your ancestors, and of  as the native land of Eurysaces, or of  as the home of the yet earlier Aeacus, to impress Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes, how you must expect to be laughed at!  Why, I am afraid we are quite outdone by those persons in pride of birth and upbringing altogether.  Or have you not observed how great are the advantages of the Spartan kings, and how their wives are kept under statutory ward of the ephors, in order that every possible precaution may be taken against the king being born\nof any but the Heracleidae?  And the Persian king so far surpasses us that no one has a suspicion that he could have been born of anybody but the king before him;  and hence the king's wife has nothing to guard her except fear.  When the eldest son, the heir to the throne, is born, first of all the king's subjects who are in his palace have a feast, and then for ever after on that date the whole of  celebrates the king's birthday with sacrifice and feasting:  but when we are born, as the comic poet says,\n Alcibiades.  After that comes the nurture of the child, not at the hands of a woman-nurse of little worth, but of the most highly approved eunuchs in the king's service, who are charged with the whole tendance of the new-born child, and especially with the business of making him as handsome as possible by moulding his limbs into a correct shape;  and while doing this they are in high honor. \nWhen the boys are seven years old they are given horses and have riding lessons, and they begin to follow the chase.  And when the boy reaches fourteen years he is taken over by the royal tutors, as they call them there:  these are four men chosen as the most highly esteemed among the Persians of mature age, namely, the wisest one, the justest one, the most temperate one,\nand the bravest one.  The first of these teaches him the magian lore of Zoroaster, son of Horomazes;  and that is the worship of the gods:  he teaches him also what pertains to a king.  The justest teaches him to be truthful all his life long;  the most temperate, not to be mastered by even a single pleasure, in order that he may be accustomed to be a free man and a veritable king, who is the master first of all that is in him, not the slave;  while the bravest trains him to be fearless and undaunted, telling him that to be daunted is to be enslaved.  But you,\nAlcibiades, had a tutor set over you by Pericles from amongst his servants,who was old as to be the most useless of them, Zopyrus the Thracian.  I might describe to you at length the nurture and education of your competitors, were it not too much of a task;  and besides, what I have said suffices to show the rest that follows thereon.  But about your birth, Alcibiades, or nurture or education, or about those of any other Athenian, one may say that nobody cares, unless it be some lover whom you chance to have.  And again, if you chose to glance at the wealth, the luxury,\nthe robes with sweeping trains, the anointings with myrrh, the attendant troops of menials, and all the other refinements of the Persians, you would be ashamed at your own case, on perceiving its inferiority to theirs. Should you choose, again, to look at the temperance and orderliness, the facility and placidity, the magnanimity and discipline, the courage and endurance, and the toil-loving, success-loving, honor-loving spirit of the Spartans, you would count yourself but a child\nin all these things.  If again you regard wealth, and think yourself something in that way, I must not keep silence on this point either, if you are to realize where you stand.  For in this respect you have only to look at the wealth of the Spartans, and you will perceive that our riches here are far inferior to theirs.  Think of all the land that they have both in their own and in the Messenian country:  not one of our estates could compete with theirs in extent and excellence, nor again in ownership of slaves, and especially of those of the helot class, nor yet of horses,\nnor of all the flocks and herds that graze in .  However, I pass over all these things:  but there is more gold and silver privately held in  than in the whole of ;  for during many generations treasure has been passing in to them from every part of , and often from the barbarians also, but not passing out to anyone;  and just as in the fable of Aesop,\nwhere the fox remarked to the lion on the direction of the footmarks, the traces of the money going into  are clear enough, but nowhere are any to be seen of it coming out;  so that one can be pretty sure that those people are the richest of the Greeks in gold and silver, and that among themselves the richest is the king;  for the largest and most numerous receipts of the kind are those of the kings,\nand besides there is the levy of the royal tribute in no slight amount, which the Spartans pay to their kings.  Now, the Spartan fortunes, though great compared with the wealth of other Greeks, are nought beside that of the Persians and their king.  For I myself was once told by a trustworthy person, who had been up to their court, that he traversed a very large tract of excellent land, nearly a day's journey, which the inhabitants called the girdle of the king's wife, and another which was similarly called her veil; \nand many other fine and fertile regions reserved for the adornment of the consort;  and each of these regions was named after some part of her apparel.  So I imagine, if someone should say to the king's mother Amestris, who was wife of Xerxes, The son of Deinomache intends to challenge your son;  the mother's dresses are worth perhaps fifty minae at the outside, while the son has under three hundred acres at Erchiae, she would wonder to what on earth this\nAlcibiades could be trusting, that he proposed to contend against Artaxerxes;  and I expect she would remarkThe only possible things that the man can be trusting to for his enterprise are industry and wisdom;  for these are the only things of any account among the Greeks.  Whereas if she were informed that this Alcibiades who is actually making such an attempt is, in the first place, as yet barely twenty years old, and secondly, altogether uneducated;  and further, that when his lover tells him that he must first learn, and take pains over himself, and practise,\nbefore he enters on a contest with the king, he refuses, and says he will do very well as he is;  I expect she would ask in surprise, On what, then, can the youngster rely?  And if we told her, On beauty, stature, birth, wealth, and mental gifts, she would conclude we were mad, Alcibiades, when she compared the advantages of her own people in all these respects.  And I imagine that even Lampido, daughter of Leotychides\nand wife of Archidamus and mother of Agis, who have all been kings, would wonder in the same way, when she compared her people's resources, at your intention of having a contest with her son despite your bad upbringing.  And yet, does it not strike you as disgraceful that our enemies' wives should have a better idea of the qualities that we need for an attempt against them than we have ourselves?  Ah, my remarkable friend, listen to me and the Delphic motto,\nKnow thyself;  for these people are our competitors, not those whom you think;  and there is nothing that will give us ascendancy over them save only pains and skill.  If you are found wanting in these, you will be found wanting also in achievement of renown among Greeks and barbarians both;  and of this I observe you to be more enamored than anyone else ever was of anything.",

He neither prayed for that, nor thought he did, but there are others who are in the opposite case.  For I imagine that if the god to whom you are now going should appear to you and first ask you, before you made any prayer, whether you would be content to become sovereign of the Athenian state and, on your accounting this as something poor and unimportant, should add and of all the Greeks also;  and if he saw\nyou were still unsatisfied unless he promised you besides the mastery of all , and should not merely promise you that, but on the self-same day a recognition by all men, if you so desired, of Alcibiades, son of Cleinias, as their sovereignI imagine you would actually depart in a transport of delight, as having secured the greatest of goods.",

Yet we could tell of\n    \"> many ere now who, having desired sovereignty, and endeavored to secure it, with the idea of working for their good, have lost their lives by plots which their sovereignty has provoked.  And I expect you are not unacquainted with certain events   when Archelaus, the monarch of , was slain by his favorite, who was as much in love with the monarchy as Archelaus was with him, and who killed his lover\nwith the expectation of being not only the monarch, but also a happy man:  but after holding the monarchy for three or four days he was plotted against by others in his turn, and perished.  You have only to look at some of our own citizensand these are examples that we know, not by hearsay, but by personal observationwho in their time have desired to hold military command\nand have obtained it, and see how some to this very day are exiles from our city, while others have lost their lives.  And even those who are deemed to be faring best have not only gone through many dangers and terrors in holding their command, but on returning home have continued to be as sorely besieged by informers as they were by the enemy, so that some of them wished to heaven\nthat they had been anything but commanders rather than have held such appointments.  Of course, if these dangers and toils were conducive to our advantage, there would be some reason for them;  but the case is quite the contrary.  And you will find it is just the same in regard to children:  some people have been known to pray that they might have them, and when they have got them have fallen into the greatest disasters and pains.  For some have had children that were utterly bad, and have spent their whole lives in repining;  while others, though they had good ones,\nwere bereft of them by disasters that overtook them, and thus were cast into as great misfortune as the others, and wished that no children at all had been born to them.  But nevertheless, with all this plain evidence, and a great deal more of a similar kind, before men's eyes, it is rare to find anyone who has either declined what was offered to him or, when he was likely to gain something by prayer, refrained from praying.  Most men would not decline the offer of either a monarchy or a generalship\n    or any of the various other things which bring with them harm rather than benefit, but would even pray to be granted them in cases where they were lacking:  but after a little while they often change their tune, and retract all their former prayers.  I question therefore if men are not really wrong in blaming the gods as the authors of their ills, when or unwisdom, shall we say?\n     It would seem, at any rate, Alcibiades, that one old poet had some wisdom;  for I conceive it was because he had some foolish friends, whom he saw working and praying for things that were not for their advantage, though supposed to be by them, that he made a common prayer on behalf of them all, in terms something like these:\nSo then, to my mind the poet spoke well and soundly;  but if you have thought of an answer to his words, do not be silent.",

For poetry as a whole is by nature\ninclined to riddling, and it is not every man who can apprehend it.  And furthermore, besides having this natural tendency, when it gets hold of a grudging person who wishes not to show forth to us his own wisdom but to conceal it as much as possible, we find it an extraordinarily difficult matter to make out whatever this or that one of them may mean.  For surely you do not suppose that Homer, divinest and wisest of poets, did not know it was impossible to know ill;  for it is he who says of Margites that he knew many things,\nbut knew them all ill:  but it is a riddle, I think, in which he has made ill stand for evil, and knew for to know.  So if we put it together, letting the meter go, indeed, but grasping his meaning, we get this:  Full many crafts he knew, but it was evil for him to know them all. Then clearly, if it was evil for him to know many things, he was in fact a paltry fellow, assuming we are to believe what we have previously argued.",

      "texte": "Then it is their admiration of this poet, Alcibiades,\nor perhaps the result of their own study, that causes the Spartans to offer a similar prayer whether the occasion be private or publicthat the gods will give them for their own benefit the beautiful as well as the good:  more than this no one can ever hear them pray for.  The consequence is that to the present time they have been just as fortunate as any other people;  and if it has befallen them to be not invariably fortunate, it was anyhow not owing to their prayer. \nIt rests with the gods, I conceive, to give us either what we may pray for or the reverse. And I would like to give you an account of something else, which I once heard from some of my seniors.  A quarrel having arisen between the Athenians and the Spartans, it befell our city to be always unsuccessful in every battle by land and sea, and she could never win a victory.  So the Athenians, in their annoyance at this result, and at a loss for some means of finding a deliverance from the trouble they were in,\ntook counsel together and decided that the best thing they could do was to send and inquire of Ammon;  and moreover, to ask also for what reason the gods granted victory to the Spartans rather than to themselves:  for wesuch was the message offer up to them more and finer sacrifices than any of the Greeks, and have adorned their temples with votive emblems as no other people have done, and presented to the gods the costliest and stateliest processions year by year, and spent more money thus than\nall the rest of the Greeks together.  But the Spartans have never taken any such pains, and indeed are so neglectful in their behavior to the gods, that they make a practice of sacrificing defective victims, and generally are very much behind us in the honors that they pay, though the wealth they possess is quite equal to that of our city. When they had so spoken, and added the question, what they should do in order to find a deliverance from the trouble they were in,\nthe prophet's only answer  evidently it was all that the god allowedwas to call them to him and say:  Thus saith Ammon to the Athenians:  I would rather have the reverent reserve of the Spartans than all the ritual of the Greeks. So much he said, and not a word further.  Now by reverent reserve I suppose the god could only mean their prayer, since in fact it differs greatly from those that are generally offered. \nFor the Greeks in general either lead up bulls with gilded horns, or else present the gods with votive emblems, and pray for any odd thing, whether it be good or bad:  so when the gods hear their irreverent speech they reject all these costly processions and sacrifices.  Whereas I think we ought to be very cautious, and fully consider what is to be said and what is not. And in Homer too you will find other tales of a similar sort.  For he relates how the Trojans,\n    in making their bivouac,and how the winds bore the sweet savour from the plain into heaven:\nSo it was nothing to their purpose to sacrifice and pay tribute of gifts in vain, when they were hated by the gods.  For it is not, I imagine, the way of the gods to be seduced with gifts, like a base insurer.  And indeed it is but silly talk of ours, if we claim to surpass the Spartans on this score.  For it would be a strange thing if the gods had regard to our gifts and sacrifices instead of our souls, and the piety and\njustice that may be found in any of us.  Far rather at these, I believe, do they look than at those costly processions and sacrifices which are offered, it well may be, by individual and state, year in, year out, though they may have offended greatly against the gods, or as greatly against their neighbors.  But the gods are not to be won by bribes, and so they despise all these things, as Ammon and the holy prophet say.  Certainly it would seem that justice and wisdom are held in especial honor both by the gods and by men of intelligence; \nand wise and just are they alone who know what acts and words to use towards gods and men.  But I should like now to hear what may be your opinion on the subject.",

He dispatched a fifty-oared galley for Anacreon of , and brought him into our city.  Simonides of  he always had about him, prevailing on him by plenteous fees and gifts.  All this he did from a wish to educate the citizens, in order that he might have subjects of the highest excellence;  for he thought it not right to grudge wisdom to any, so noble and good was he.  And when his people in the city had been educated and were admiring him for his wisdom,\nhe proceeded next, with the design of educating those of the countryside, to set up figures of Hermes for them along the roads in the midst of the city and every district town;  and then, after selecting from his own wise lore, both learnt from others and discovered for himself, the things that he considered the wisest, he threw these into elegiac form and inscribed them on the figures as verses of his own and testimonies of his wisdom, so that in the first place\nhis people should not admire those wise Delphic legends of  and , and the other sayings of the sort, but should rather regard as wise the utterances of Hipparchus;  and that in the second place, through passing up and down and reading his words and acquiring a taste for his wisdom, they might resort hither from the country for the completion of their education.  There are two such inscriptions of his:  on the left side\nof each Hermes there is one in which the god says that he stands in the midst of the city or the township, while on the right side he says:There are many other fine inscriptions from his poems on other figures of Hermes, and this one in particular, on the Steiria road, in which he says:\nI therefore should never dare, I am sure, to deceive you, who are my friend, or disobey the great Hipparchus, after whose death the Athenians were for three years under the despotic rule of his brother Hippias, and you might have heard anyone of the earlier period say that it was only in these years that there was despotism in , and that at all other times the Athenians lived very much as in the reign of Cronos.  And the subtler sort of people say\nthat Hipparchus's death was due, not to the cause supposed by mostthe disqualification of the assassin's sister from bearing the basket, for that is a silly motivebut because Harmodius had become the favorite of Aristogeiton and had been educated by him.  Thus Aristogeiton also prided himself on educating people, and he regarded Hipparchus as a dangerous rival.  And at that time, it is said, Harmodius\nhappened to be himself in love with one of the handsome and well-born youths of the day;  they do tell his name, but I cannot remember it.  Well, for a while this youth admired both Harmodius and Aristogeiton as wise men, but afterwards, when he associated with Hipparchus, he despised them, and they were so overcome with the pain of this disqualification that they slew Hipparchus.",

But how you came to form this opinion, that I would be better able to be of use to your son in his aim of becoming a good citizen than you would yourself, and how he came to suppose that I rather than yourself would be of use to himthis does fill me with wonder. For you,\nin the first place, are my elder, and further, you have held in your time many of the highest offices in , and are respected by the people of Anagyrus above all your fellow-townsmen, and by the whole state as much as any man, whereas neither of you can notice anything like this about me. And moreover, if Theages here does despise the instruction of our statesmen, and is looking for some other persons who profess to be able to educate young people, we have here Prodicus of , Gorgias of Leontini, Polus of ,\nand many more, who are so wise that they go to our cities and persuade the noblest and wealthiest of our young menwho have the choice of learning from any citizen they choose, free of chargethey persuade them to abandon that instruction and learn from them, with a deposit, besides, of a large sum of money as their fee, and to feel thankful in addition. Some of these persons might naturally have been chosen both by your son and by yourself, in preference to me; \nfor I have no knowledge of those fair and beatific subjects of study:  I only wish that I had. But what I always say, you know, is that I am in the position of knowing practically nothing except one little subject, that of love-matters. In this subject, however, I claim to be skilled above anybody who has ever lived or is now living in the world.",

It is a voice that, when it occurs, always indicates to me a prohibition of something I may be about to do, but never urges me on to anything;  and if one of my friends consults me and the voice occurs, the same thing happens:  it prohibits, and does not allow him to act. And I will produce witnesses to convince you of these facts. You know our Charmides here, who has grown so handsome, the son of Glaucon: \nhe once happened to be consulting me on his intention of training for the Nemean races, and he had no sooner begun to say that he intended to train than the voice occurred, and I tried to prevent him, sayingJust as you were speaking my spirit-voice has occurred:  no, you must not train.  Perhaps, said he, it indicates to you that I shall not win;  but even if I am not to win, at any rate the exercise I shall get in the meantime will do me good. So saying, he went and trained;  and so you may as well inquire of him\nas to the results he got from his training. Or if you like, ask Cleitomachus, brother of Timarchus, what Timarchus said to him when he was going straight to the prison to meet his death, he and Euathlus the racing runner, who had harbored Timarchus as a fugitive;  for he will tell you that the words he spoke to him were these:",

      "Loc": "129b",
      "texte": "Cleitomachus, he said, I tell you I am going to my death now, because I would not take Socrates' advice. Now, why on earth did Timarchus say that? I will tell you. When Timarchus and Philemon,\nson of Philemonides, got up from the wine-party to kill Nicias, son of Heroscamandrus, those two alone had knowledge of the plot;  and Timarchus, as he got up, said to me: What say you, Socrates? Go on drinking, all of you;  I have to get up and go somewhere, but I will join you a little later, if I get the chance. Then occurred that voice of mine, and I said to him: No, no, do not get up;  for my accustomed spiritual sign has occurred to me.\nSo he stopped. Then after an interval of time he again started to go, and said: Well, I am going, Socrates. Again the voice occurred, and so again I constrained him to stop. The third time, wishing to give me the slip, he got up without saying another word to me;  he gave me the slip by watching until my attention was turned elsewhere. Thus it was that he went right off and committed the deed which was the cause of his going then to his death. And hence it was that he spoke those words to his brother which I quoted to you just now, that he was going to his death because he had not taken my advice.\nAnd moreover, in regard to the Sicilian business, many will tell you what I said about the destruction of the army. As to bygones, you may hear from those who know:  but there is an opportunity now of testing the worth of what the sign says. For as the handsome Sannio was setting out on campaign, the sign occurred to me, and he has gone now with Thrasyllus on an expedition bound for  and . I accordingly expect him to be either killed or brought very near it, and I have great fears for our force as a whole.\nNow I have told you all this, because this spiritual power that attends me also exerts itself to the full in my intercourse with those who spend their time with me. To many, indeed, it is adverse, and it is not possible for these to get any good by conversing with me, and I am therefore unable to spend my time in conversing with them. And there are many with whom it does not prohibit my intercourse, yet the intercourse does them no good. But those who are assisted in their intercourse by that spiritual power are the persons whom you have noticed;  for they make rapid progress there and then. And of these, again, who make progress some find the benefit\nboth solid and enduring;  while there are many who, for as long a time as they are with me, make wonderful progress, but when they are parted from me relapse, and are no different from anybody else. This once befell Aristeides, son of Lysimachus, son of Aristeides. For by conversing with me he had made immense progress in a little time;  and then he had to go on an expedition, and he went and sailed away. On his return he found that Thucydides, son of Melesias, son of Thucydides, had been conversing with me. Now Thucydides, the day before, had quarrelled with me\nover some arguments we had had. So when Aristeides saw me, after greeting me and talking of other affairs, he said: But Thucydides, I hear, Socrates, is somewhat on his dignity with you, and is annoyed as though he were somebody. Yes, that is so, I replied. Well, but does he not know, he said, what a sad slave he was, before he associated with you?  It seems not, I replied, upon my soul.  But indeed I myself also, he said, am in a ridiculous position,\nSocrates.  How exactly? I asked. Because, he replied, before I sailed away, I was able to discuss things with anybody, and show myself inferior to none in argument, so that I even sought out the debates of the most accomplished people:  but now, on the contrary, I shun them, wherever I notice there is anyone of education, so ashamed I am of my own ineptitude.  Tell me, I said, did this power forsake you of a sudden, or little by little?  Little by little, he replied. And when it was present with you, I asked,\nwas it present through your having learnt something from me, or in some other way?  I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what is incredible, upon my soul, yet true. For I never yet learnt anything from you, as you know yourself:  but I made progress, whenever I was with you, if I was merely in the same house, without being in the same room, but more progress, when I was in the same room. And it seemed to me to be much more when I was in the same room and looked at you as you were speaking, than when\nI turned my eyes elsewhere:  but my progress was far the greatest and most marked whenever I sat beside you and held and touched you. Now, however, he said, that condition has all oozed away.Such then, Theages, is the intercourse you would have with me:  if God so wills, you will make very great and rapid progress, but otherwise, you will not. Consider, therefore, if it is not safer for you to be educated by one of those persons who have command themselves of the benefit which they bestow on mankind, rather than follow the course on which you may chance with me.",

Or if any of ourselves says he has had no teacher, but has however some works of his own to speak of, and can point out to us what Athenians or strangers, either slaves or freemen, are acknowledged to owe their goodness to him, let him do so.  But if there is nothing of the sort to be found amongst us, let us bid them look elsewhere;  for we cannot run a risk with our good friends' children where we may ruin them, and so bring upon us the most grievous of accusations from our nearest and dearest.  Now I, Lysimachus and Melesias, am the first to avow\nthat I have had no teacher in this respect;  and yet I have longed for such lessons from my youth up.  But I have not the means to pay fees to the sophists, who were the only persons that professed to be able to make me a complete gentleman;  and to this moment I remain powerless to discover the art myself.  But I should not be surprised if Nicias or Laches has discovered or learnt it:  for they have more means at their command to enable them to learn from others, and they are also older, and have had time to discover it.  Indeed, I regard them as able to educate a man; \nfor they would never declare their minds so freely on pursuits that are beneficial or harmful to a youth unless they felt confident that they had the requisite knowledge.  And I have entire confidence in them myself, except that I wondered at their differing from each other.  I therefore make this counter-request of you, Lysimachus:  just as Laches urged you a moment ago not to release me but to ask me questions, so I now call upon you not to release Laches or Nicias, but to question them in these terms:  Socrates says\nthat he has no understanding of the matter, and that he is not competent to decide which of your statements is true;  that he has never been either a discoverer or a learner of anything of the sort.  But you, Laches and Nicias, are each to tell us who is the cleverest person you have heard on the upbringing of youth;  whether you have knowledge of it by learning from someone or by discovering it yourselves;  and if you learnt it, who were your teachers respectively, and\nwhat other colleagues they had:  in order that, if you are not at leisure through the demands of public business, we may go to them and induce them either with gifts or good turns or with both to undertake the care of our and your children together, and so prevent them from turning out knaves and disgracing their ancestors.  But if you have made the grand discovery yourselves, give us an instance to show what other persons you have succeeded in changing, by your care of them, from knaves to honest gentlemen.  For if you are now going to make your first attempt at educating,\nyou must beware lest you try your experiment, not on a corpus vile, but on your sons and the children of your friends, and you prove to be a mere case, as the proverbial saying has it, of starting pottery on a wine-jar.  So tell us what you claim, or do not claim, as your resources and acquirements in this kind. There, Lysimachus, demand that from these good persons, and do not let them off.",

What other persons have we made better?are perhaps of a kind on which we might well examine ourselves:\nbut I believe this other way of inquiring leads to the same thing, and will probably also start more from the beginning.  For if we happen to know of such and such a thing that by being joined to another thing it makes this thing better, and further, if we are able to get the one joined to the other, we obviously know the thing itself on which we might be consulting as to how it might be best and most easily acquired.  Now I daresay you do not grasp my meaning.  Well, you will grasp it more easily in this way.  If we happen to know\nthat sight joined to eyes makes those eyes the better for it, and further if we are able to get it joined to eyes, we obviously know what this faculty of sight is, on which we might be consulting as to how it might be best and most easily acquired.  For if we did not know first of all what sight or hearing is, we should hardly prove ourselves consultants or physicians of credit in the matter of eyes or ears, and the best way\nof acquiring sight or hearing.",

It seems to your friend and me that, to take the various subjects of knowledge, there is not one knowledge of how a thing has happened in the past, another of how things are happening in the present, and another of how a thing that has not yet happened might or will happen most favorably in the future, but it is the same knowledge throughout.  For example, in the case of health, it is medicine always and alone that surveys present, past, and future processes alike;\nand farming is in the same position as regards the productions of the earth.  And in matters of war;  I am sure you yourselves will bear me out when I say that here generalship makes the best forecasts on the whole, and particularly of future results, and is the mistress rather than the servant of the seer's art, because it knows better what is happening or about to happen\nin the operations of war;  whence the law ordains that the general shall give orders to the seer, and not the seer to the general.

In regard to the plants, as you know, we who cultivate the earth find it the easiest part of our work to make all our preparations that are needed before planting, and to do the planting itself;  but when the plant begins to grow, thenceforward we have a great deal of difficult and vexatious business in tending the new growth.\nSuch, it seems, is also the case in regard to men:  I take my own concerns as evidence for judging of the rest. For indeed I have found the planting, or the procreationwhichever one ought to call itof this son of mine the easiest thing in the world;  but his upbringing has been vexatious and a constant source of alarm, so great are my fears for him. Among the many instances that I could mention, the desire which occupies him at the moment is a thing that especially alarms me:  for it is not an ill-bred desire, but a dangerous one, since here we have him, Socrates, as he says, desiring to become wise.\nMy opinion is that some of his fellow-townsmen, about his own age, who pay visits to the city, excite him with accounts of certain discussions they have heard there;  and in his envy of these he has long been pestering me with the demand that I should take due thought for his needs, and pay fees to some sophist or other who will make him wise. Now I do not mind so much about the fees, but I believe he is running into no slight danger\nwhere he is hastening. I did for a time restrain him with good advice;  but since I am no longer able to do so, I believe my best course is to comply with his request, in order that he may not resort, perchance, behind my back to somebody who will corrupt him. So I have come now on this very business of placing this youth with one of these sophists, or purveyors of wisdom, as they are held to be. It is a happy chance, therefore, that has thrown you in our way, as I should be particularly glad, with this plan of action in my mind, to ask your advice. Come, if you have any advice to give\non what you have heard from me, you not only may, but should, give it.",

However, we will tell you now;  for we think we should speak our minds freely to friends like you.  Some people, of course, pour ridicule on such appeals, and when consulted for their advice will not say what they think,\nbut something different, making the inquirer's wishes their aim, and speaking against their own judgement.  But you, we consider, not merely have the necessary discernment but will give us the benefit of it in telling us just what is in your minds and hence we have enlisted your counsel on the question which we are about to lay before you.  Now the matter about which I have made all this long preamble is this: \nwe have two sons here, my friend that one, called Thucydides after his grandfather, and I this one;  he also is named in the same way, after my father;  we call him Aristeides.  Well, we have resolved to give them our most constant care, and notas most fathers do when their boys begin to be young menlet them run loose as their fancy leads them, but begin forthwith taking\nevery possible care of them.  Now, knowing that you too have sons, we thought that you above all men must have concerned yourselves with the question of the kind of upbringing that would make the best of them;  and if by any chance you have not given your attention to the subject, we would remind you that it ought not to be neglected, and we invite you to join us in arranging some way of taking care of our sons. How we formed this resolve, Nicias and Laches, is worth hearing, even though the story be somewhat long.  My friend Melesias and I take our meals together,\nand our boys share our table.  Now, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are going to speak quite freely to you.  Each of us has many noble deeds of his own father to relate to these young fellowstheir numerous achievements both in war and in peace, when they were managing the affairs either of the allies or of this city;  but neither of us has any deeds of his own to tell.  We cannot help feeling ashamed that our boys should observe this, and we blame our fathers\nfor leaving us to indulge ourselves when we began to be young men, while they looked after other folks' affairs;  and we point the moral of it all to these young people, telling them that if they are careless of themselves and will not take our advice they will win no reputation, but if they take due pains they may very likely come to be worthy of the names they bear.  Now they, for their part, say they will do as we bid;  so we are now considering what lessons or pursuits will lead them to the highest attainable excellence. Someone directed us to this particular accomplishment\nof fighting in armor, as being an admirable one for a young man to learn;  and he praised that man whose performance you were just watching, and then urged us to go and see him.  So we decided that it would be well to go and see the man ourselves, and to take you along with us not merely as companions at the show, but also as counsellors and copartners, if you will be so good, in the matter of looking after our sons. \nThat is the question which we wanted to discuss with you.  And we look to you now, on your part, to give us your advice, first as to whether you think this accomplishment should be learnt or not, and then as to any other such art or pursuit that you can recommend for a young man;  and also, how you feel inclined as regards our partnership.",

And it is only right that you should:  for you happen to be our friend through your father he and I were constant companions and friends, and he died without ever having a single difference with me.  And a certain recollection comes back to me on hearing what has just been said:  for these boys, in talking with each other at home, frequently mention Socrates in terms of high praise;  but I have never asked them whether they meant the son of Sophroniscus. \nNow tell me, my boys, is this the Socrates whose name you have mentioned so often?",

That, however, you will do yourself, and we will remind you of it another time:  but what do you say of the matter on which we began to speak?  What is your view?  Is the accomplishment of fighting in armor a suitable one for our boys to learn or not?",

For I and Melesias here would certainly be delighted if you would consent to expound in detail all that Socrates puts to you in his questions:  as I began by saying at the outset, we invited you to consult with us just because we thought, very naturally, that you had given serious consideration to this kind of thing, especially as your boys,\nlike ours, are almost of an age to be educated.  Accordingly, if it is all the same to you, discuss it now by joint inquiry with Socrates, exchanging view's with him in turn:  for it is a particularly good remark of his that we are consulting now about the greatest of all our concerns.  Come, see if you consider that this is the proper course to take.",

It is good for them, instead of spending their time on the ordinary things to which young men usually give their hours of leisure, to spend it on this, which not only has the necessary effect of improving their bodily health\nsince it is as good and strenuous as any physical exercisebut is also a form of exercise which, with riding, is particularly fitting for a free citizen;  for only the men trained in the use of these warlike implements can claim to be trained in the contest whereof we are athletes and in the affairs wherein we are called upon to contend. Further, this accomplishment will be of some benefit also in actual battle, when it comes to fighting in line with a number of other men;  but its greatest advantage will be felt when the ranks are broken, and you find you must fight man to man, either in pursuing someone who is trying to beat off your attack,\nor in retreating yourself and beating off the attack of another.  Whoever possessed this accomplishment could come to no harm so long as he had but one to deal with, nor yet, perhaps, if he had several;  it would give him an advantage in any situation. Moreover, it is a thing which impels one to desire another noble accomplishment;  for everyone who has learnt how to fight in armor will desire to learn the accomplishment which comes next, the management of troops;  and when he has got that and once taken a pride in his work\nhe will push on to attain the whole art of generalship.  It is evident already that all accomplishments and pursuits in the military sphere are both honourable and valuable to a man, either in acquisition or in practice;  and this particular one may well be an introduction to them.  And we can make this additionno slight oneto its claims, that this science will make any man individually a great deal bolder and braver in war.  Nor let us disdain to mention, even though some may think it a rather slight matter, that it will give him a smarter appearance in the place\nwhere a man should look smartest, and where at the same time he will appear more terrible to the enemy because of his smartness.  So my opinion is, Lysimachus, as I say, that we ought to teach this skill to our young men, and I have told you my reasons for so thinking. But if Laches has a different view to state, I shall be as glad as anyone to hear it.",

Now I am accustomed to him, and so I know that one is bound to be thus treated by him, and further, that I myself shall certainly get the same treatment also.  For I delight, Lysimachus, in conversing with the man, and see no harm in our being reminded of\nany past or present misdoing:  nay, one must needs take more careful thought for the rest of one's life, if one does not fly from his words but is willing, as Solon said, and zealous to learn as long as one lives, and does not expect to get good sense by the mere arrival of old age.  So to me there is nothing unusual, or unpleasant either, in being tried and tested by Socrates;  in fact, I knew pretty well all the time that our argument would not be about the boys if Socrates were present, but about ourselves. \nLet me therefore repeat that there is no objection on my part to holding a debate with Socrates after the fashion that he likes;  but you must see how Laches here feels on the matter.",

You are quite right in saying that, Lysimachus; \nbut to invite us to be your advisers for the education of your boys, and not to invite Socrates here, is to me very strange, when, to begin with, he is of your district, and then he is always spending his time wherever there is any such excellent study or pursuit for young men as you are seeking.",

      "Loc": "182e",
      "texte": "Well, Nicias, I am loth to say of any sort of accomplishment that it ought not to be learnt;  for it seems good to know all things.  And besides,\nif this skill in arms is an accomplishment, as they say who teach it, and as Nicias terms it, it ought to be learnt;  while if it is not an accomplishment, and those who promise to give it are deceiving us, or if it is an accomplishment, but not a very important one, what can be the good of learning it?  I speak of it in this way from the following point of view:  I conceive that if there were anything in it, it would not have been overlooked by the Lacedaemonians, whose only concern in life is to seek out and practise\nwhatever study or pursuit will give them an advantage over others in war.  And if they have overlooked it, at any rate these teachers of it cannot have overlooked the obvious fact that the Lacedaemonians are more intent on such matters than any of the Greeks, and that anybody who won honour among them for this art would amass great riches elsewhere, just as a tragic poet does who has won honor among us.  And for this reason he who thinks himself a good writer of tragedy\ndoes not tour round with his show in a circuit of the outlying Attic towns, but makes a straight line for this place and exhibits to our people, as one might expect. But I notice that these fighters in armour regard  as holy ground where none may tread, and do not step on it even with the tips of their toes, but circle round it and prefer to exhibit to any other people, especially to those who would themselves admit that they were inferior to many in the arts of war.  Furthermore, Lysimachus, I have come across more than a few of these persons\nin actual operations, and I can see their quality.  Indeed, we can estimate it offhand:  for, as though it were of set purpose, not one of these experts in arms has ever yet distinguished himself in war.  And yet in all the other arts, the men who have made a name are to be found among those who have specially pursued one or other of them;  while these persons, apparently, stand out from the rest in this particularly hapless fate of their profession.  Why, this man Stesilaus, whom you watched with me in that great crowd as he gave his performance\nand spoke in those high terms of himself before us, I have watched elsewhere giving a finer entertainment in the form of a very real display that he made against his will.  The ship on which he was serving struck a transport vessel, and he was using in the fight a combination of a scythe and a speara remarkable weapon that suited so remarkable a man.  Well, the story of this fellow's doings is hardly of enough interest in the main, but you must hear the upshot of his device of a scythe fixed to a spear. \nAs he was fighting, it stuck somehow in the other ship's rigging, and held fast;  so Stesilaus pulled at it in the hope of getting it free, but he could not, and the ships were passing by each other.  For the first moments he ran along in his ship holding on to his spear;  but as the other ship sheered off from his and drew him after, still holding the spear, he let it slip through his hand\nuntil he gripped the butt-end of the shaft.  From the crew of the transport there came laughter and clapping at his posture, and when someone aimed a stone at him which hit the deck near his feet, and he let go the spear, the troops on the warship in their turn could no longer restrain their laughter, as they saw the notable scythe-spear dangling from the transport.  Now, there may perhaps be something in this art of theirs, as Nicias argues, but at any rate that is my impression of it, in the cases I have met with.  Hence, as I said at the beginning,\nwhether it be an accomplishment, and one of but little use, or not an accomplishment, but only supposed and pretended to be such, it is not worth the trouble of learning it.  For indeed I hold that if a man who was a coward believed that he possessed it, his only gain would be in rashness, which would make his true nature the more conspicuous;  while if he were brave, people would be on the look-out for even the slightest mistake on his part, and he would incur much grievous slander;  for the pretension to such skill\narouses jealousy, so that unless a man be prodigiously superior to the rest in valor he cannot by any means escape being made a laughing-stock through professing to be so skilled.  Such is my opinion, Lysimachus, of the interest taken in this accomplishment;  but do as I told you at the beginning;  you are not to let our friend Socrates go, but must request him to advise us according to his judgement on the matter in hand.",

For you might think me a lover, and yet also a hater, of discussions:  for when I hear a man discussing virtue or any kind of wisdom, one who is truly a man and worthy of his argument, I am exceedingly delighted; \nI take the speaker and his speech together, and observe how they sort and harmonize with each other.  Such a man is exactly what I understand by musical,he has tuned himself with the fairest harmony, not that of a lyre or other entertaining instrument, but has made a true concord of his own life between his words and his deeds, not in the Ionian, no, nor in the Phrygian nor in the Lydian, but simply in the Dorian mode, which is the sole Hellenic harmony.  Such a man makes me rejoice\nwith his utterance, and anyone would judge me then a lover of discussion, so eagerly do I take in what he says:  but a man who shows the opposite character gives me pain, and the better he seems to speak, the more I am pained, with the result, in this case, that I am judged a hater of discussion.  Now of Socrates' words I have no experience, but formerly, I fancy, I have made trial of his deeds;  and there I found him living up to any fine words however freely spoken. \nSo if he has that gift as well, his wish is mine, and I should be very glad to be cross-examined by such a man, and should not chafe at learning;  but I too agree with Solon, while adding just one word to his saying:  I should like, as I grow old, to learn more and more, but only from honest folk.  Let him concede to me that my teacher is himself goodelse I shall dislike my lessons and be judged a duncebut if you say that my teacher is to be a younger man,\n or one who so far has no reputation, or anything of that sort, I care not a jot.  I therefore invite you, Socrates, both to teach and to refute me as much as you please, and to learn too what I on my part know;  such is the position you hold in my eyes since that day on which you came through the same danger with me, and gave a proof of your own valour which is to be expected of anyone who hopes to justify his good name.  So say whatever you like, leaving out of account\nthe difference of our ages.",
